Some number of weeks ago, having discovered Maraschino liqueur, I concocted a
variation on my beloved Manhattan. I have been meaning to write up the recipe
here for a while but had been stuck on coming up with a name; I needed a name
befitting a strong whiskey cocktail with connections to myself and the color
red. Having thought for quite a while and come up with a bunch of names that
were already taken by other cocktails, I settled on naming the drink after the
grizzled, old Autobot, Ironhide. So, without further ado:

Ironhide recipe
---------------

* 3 oz Bourbon whiskey
* 3/4 oz Maraschino
* 1/4 oz grenadine
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters
* 1 Maraschino cherry

Serve shaken or stirred with ice in a cocktail glass; garnish with the
Maraschino cherry.

Notes
-----

I have mostly been drinking these on the rocks, which is an acceptable but
inferior variation. Being a Manhattan-like cocktail, up-high is really the
correct way to serve an Ironhide.

Corn syrup based grenadine or "maraschino" cherries will ruin the flavors
imparted by the bitters and Maraschino; you will make a better cocktail by
skipping the grenadine and cherry than using cheap, fake ones.
