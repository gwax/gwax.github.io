Some num­ber of weeks ago, hav­ing dis­cov­ered Maraschino liqueur, I con­cocted a vari­a­tion on my beloved Manhattan. I have been mean­ing to write up the recipe here for a while but had been stuck on com­ing up with a name; I needed a name befit­ting a strong whiskey cock­tail with con­nec­tions to myself and the color red. Having thought for quite a while and come up with a bunch of names that were already taken by other cock­tails, I set­tled on nam­ing the drink after the griz­zled, old Autobot, Ironhide. So, with­out fur­ther ado:

Ironhide recipe:

* 3 oz Bourbon whiskey
* 3/4 oz Maraschino
* 1/4 oz grenadine
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters
* 1 Maraschino cherry

Serve shaken or stirred with ice in a cock­tail glass; gar­nish with the Maraschino cherry.

Notes:

I have mostly been drink­ing these on the rocks, which is an accept­able but infe­rior vari­a­tion. Being a Manhattan-like cock­tail, up-high is really the cor­rect way to serve an Ironhide.

Corn syrup based grena­dine or “maraschino” cher­ries will ruin the fla­vors imparted by the bit­ters and Maraschino; you will make a bet­ter cock­tail by skip­ping the grena­dine and cherry than using cheap, fake ones.
