Continuing my ear­lier work in the realm of mixol­ogy, I would like to present my sec­ond cock­tail inven­tion. The inven­tion of this cock­tail is the result of play­ing around with gin, Chartreuse, St. Germain, and var­i­ous other liqueurs in an attempt to make some­thing tasty. This cock­tail earns its name, Will O’ The Wisp, from its faint, ghostly, green color.

Ingredients:

* 3/4 oz Green Chartreuse
* 3/4 oz St. Germain
* 3/4 oz White Vermouth
* 1 dash Lavender Bitters
* 3 oz Dry Gin
* 1/4 oz Herbsaint or Absinth

Recipe:

Pour the Chartreuse, St. Germain, Vermouth, Bitters, and Gin into a cock­tail shaker
Pour the Herbsaint/Absinth into a chilled cock­tail glass
Swirl the cock­tail glass, coat­ing the sides, and pour­ing off any excess Herbsaint/Absinth
Add ice to the cock­tail shaker and shake
Pour shaken cock­tail into the pre­pared glass
Notes:
The Herbsaint/Absinth can be skipped, though I don’t rec­om­mend it. The Lavender Bitters are also optional but very highly rec­om­mended. I would rec­om­mend stir­ring this cock­tail (instead of shak­ing) as the result­ing bev­er­age has a very dif­fer­ent appearance.
