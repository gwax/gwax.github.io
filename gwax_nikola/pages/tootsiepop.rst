Abstract
========

Since the invention of the Tootsie Roll Pop, many men (and women and owls)
have asked the question, "How many licks does it take to get to the center of
a Tootsie Roll Pop?" Previous research seems to suggest that one can reach
the center with three licks and a bite (ref: Mr. Owl), but this does not
sufficiently answer the question. Ongoing research is being conducted, and
preliminary results have been obtained, towards solving the problem.


Purpose
=======

The purpose of the research that is being conducted is to systematically
determine how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll
Pop.


Method
======

Materials
---------

* 1 Tootsie Roll Pop
* 1 Person

Setup
-----

#. Unwrap the Tootsie Roll Pop

Procedure
---------

#. Lick [#lick]_ side [#side]_ of the Tootsie Roll Pop
#. Rotate to other side of Tootsie Roll Pop
#. Repeat from Step 1 until center is reached [#center]_
#. Record results

.. [#lick] A lick is when your tongue is run across the Tootsie Rolls Pop; sucking
    is strictly prohibitted in this experiment. The tongue need not,
    necessarily, be retracted into the mouth between individual licks, though
    it has been found to be more pleasant for the experimenter with frequent
    tongue retraction.

.. [#side] Tootsie Roll Pops are shaped in a roughly saucer shape; the broader
    parts are being referred to as sides.

.. [#center] The center is determined to have been reached when licking yields
    the texture of Tootsie Roll, flavor of Tootsie Roll and the discoloration
    of Tootsie Roll is visible with reference to the candy portion. This
    eliminates false positives as a result of bubbles in the candy, oddly
    textured regions and seeing chocolate through candy.

Calculations
============

Minimum Licks
-------------

Since the obtained data represents the licking of both sides, the minimum
number of licks for a given Tootsie Roll Pop is half (round up) the number
of licks obtained in the trial

Mean
----

| :math:`x_0 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N x_i`
| double sided: :math:`x_0 = 508`
| single sided: :math:`x_0 = 254`

Standard Deviation
------------------

| :math:`\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N (x_i - x_0)^2}`
| double sided: :math:`\sigma = 164`
| single sided: :math:`\sigma = 82`

Conclusions
===========

The data suggests that it takes approximately 508 licks to reach the center
of a Tootsie Roll Pop when alternating the licking side. Since the procedure
calls for equal licking of both sides of the Tootsie Roll Pop and completion
is determined by core contact on either side, one could reach the core with
fewer licks by focusing on only one side of the Tootsie Roll Pop. If one were
to select the side closer to the core, it would theoretically require
approximately 254 licks to reach the center.

The data also suggests a substantial variability in the number of licks
required to reach the center, with a standard deviation of 164 licks for two
sided licking and 82 for single side licking.


Error Sources
=============

The small number of trials makes for a very large standard deviation. The
standard deviation is so large, in fact, that it is not reasonable to assume
the conclusions are accurate.


Further Research
================

More trials must be conducted to obtain more data points.

As other possible areas of research, one could look into the effects of
tongue size, saliva production, tongue retraction and other variables on the
number of licks necessary. The methods contained are easily adapted to further
experimentation.


Outside Data Contributors
=========================

Outside data contributions are accepted and greatly appreciated as long as
the outlined procedure is strictly adhered to. Contributions may be made by
sending details to waksman@gwax.com. Please include number of licks, trial date,
lollipop color and contributors full name as incomplete contributions can not
be used (trial duration is optional). Please do not contribute poisoned
data.
