			<h2>Alcohol Reviews</h2>

			<p>I've decided to take up reviewing the various alcohols that I find myself in contact with in the interests of open information exchange and my habit of liking to document anything and everything.</p>

			<p>The ratings are given on a 0 to 5 scale (0 being undrinkable and 5 being ambrosial) with a description following. My personal preferences will play a heavy role in my ratings and some people will have very diferent opinions from me on some things, especially with beers.</p>

			<p>Since this is a new review page, I haven't got enough data points to get a good rating scale set up. As such, you should consider my current scale to be a preliminary one, and I will be renormalizing it as I add more examples.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Beers (by brewery)
	    <ul>
		<li>Anchor Steam
		    <ul>
			<li>Anchor Steam Beer - 1<br />
			    This is a medium weight beer with a fair bit of heft. As far as medium weight beers go, this is drinkiable but very much not my style.
			</li>
		    </ul>
		</li>
		<li>Harpoon
		    <ul>
			<li>UFO (UnFiltered Offering) - 5<br />
			    This is a mild but full flavored hefeweizen, with a very good flavor. Good both in a bottle and on tap. As with many hefeweizens a bit of lemon will serve to improve the flavor. This is one of my favorite beers.

			<li>Blended
			    <ul>
				<li>Chivas Regal 12 Years Old - 3<br />
				    This scotch has a moderate color. The alcohol is smooth for a moment with a mild bite coming on very quickly. With the bite comes a veritable cornucopia of flavors making it difficult to place any individual flavor initially. Slowly the flavors begin to fade, the last one to fade is a pleasant one that is much like charcoal.
				</li>
				<li>Cutty Sark - 1<br />
				    This is not a scotch to be enjoyed on its own; this is a scotch to mix or get drunk on. The alcohol is not very smooth and does not provoke the taste buds in a particularly interesting manner. The price is roughly equivalent to a medium-grade vodka and serves well as a dark alternative to medium-grade vodkas. If one wants a scotch with which to make a Rob Roy or other drink, this is a decent choice.
				</li>
				<li>Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 Years Old - 2<br />
				    This scotch has a moderate color. It has a strong and somewhat pleasant aroma but it is difficult to place any specific odors. The bite is strong and is accompanied by the taste of wood, peat and a few other things. As the flavor fades, a distinct aftertaste that I can not quite recognize lingers. As this aftertaste fades, I am left with another very mild aftertaste that is very reminiscent of the taste many medium weight beers leave. This is just smooth enough to be drunk on its own and is a little too expensive to justify use in cocktails. This would be a decent choice for drinking on the rocks.
				</li>
			    </ul>
			</li>
			<li>Single Malt
			    <ul>
				<li>Glenkinchie 10 Years Old - 4<br />
				    This scotch has a fairly light color. The aroma is very mild but distinct and reminds me of fields and thin woods in the late summer. The alcohol is initially smooth and the bite comes on slowly with a mild and distinct flavor. The flavor gets stronger over time until it hits a peak. As the flavor peaks, it begins to take on a character that is very reminiscent of peat and wood. The peat and wood flavors slowly fade and mix until only one taste remains and then eventually fades as well. This was my first exposure to a single malt scotch and I found it to be quite enjoyable.
