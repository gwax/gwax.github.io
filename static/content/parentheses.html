			<h2><cite>Parentheses</cite></h2>

			<p>I have often been known to speak in a parenthetical manner (by this I mean
that I tend to make side comments that further explain what I have already been saying (this often
carries with it the effect of adding a great deal of excess information to what has been said (the
excess information is not necessarily important and it often gives the impression that I am using
very many words to say not very much at all (you may note that I have constructed a great hierarchy
of information and thought about a fairly simple statement (this is to illustrate for you a technique
(one of adding side thoughts to a simple one in a manner which explains things but leaves the original
idea simple) which I will be using throughout the rest of this document (I have not yet decided what
specific classification I should apply to this document (for example, it is not a treatise as it will
cover quite a few separate thoughts))))))) and so I thought that I might as well try to write in a
similar manner (there is mild irritation in this style of writing (parentheses come in pairs and need
to be matched (as such I need to find a way of making sure that my parentheses are matched (not doing
so would be sloppy) (that I am writing on a computer (computers are really great for word processing
(the Backspace key is a real marvel of innovation (consider the evolution of word processing
throughout history (if we start with the oldest of old (clay tablets or rocks and chisels) erasing
would have been an incredible pain (you would pretty much need to start over (either by finding
another rock or laying out another hunk of clay))) (but then one need not look very far back into
history (consider how irritating a mistake with ink (pen or typewriter) can be (you need to get out
some whiteout or a new piece of paper and redo a significant portion of your old work (with a
computer one need only press Backspace a few times (then there is also the whole issue of text
insertion and rearrangement (computers do an absolutely marvelous job of this as well))))))))) would
make me think that parentheses matching can be done automatically (it can in fact be done
automatically (not in my word processor though (parentheses matching is a feature that is associated
with programming (since I am writing, my software doesn't think that I need parentheses matching (a
cursory search doesn't turn up any software that does (I could always trick something into thinking
that I am programming (tricking software is a pain (more of a mild irritation mostly) so I'll stick
to doing the parentheses matching the old fashioned way (by hand) (you will have to forgive me if I
make mistakes (though I will try to find a way around the issue (at least before I try to do
anything with this document (such as trying to get it published))))))))))))))).</p>
			<p>This will be a philosophical (as opposed to a narrative) document (at
least in so far as I am going to be writing my philosophical thoughts (and then proceeding to flesh
them out in rather great detail (which is another reason why I have chosen the parenthetical format
(side thoughts upon side thoughts upon side thoughts (I have a feeling that the mind works like this
(or at least that my mind works like this (this carries with it the assumption that my mind works
like the minds of other people (this is not necessarily a safe assumption (it could be the case that
everyone thinks differently (we could all be completely alien consciousnesses to each other)) but I
will make it anyway (if I don't make this assumption it's not worth writing (of course I could just
make the similar assumption that there are some people that think like me (I will make this
assumption instead (it's slightly more appropriate and less facetious)))))) (a primary focus of this
document is the way the mind works (the mind is a very interesting thing (one that I doubt many
people (myself included) understand (and one that I suspect many people would like to understand
more)) (I use the term mind in a rather general manner (encompassing a lot of similar concepts
(including the conscious mind (your soul or your rational self (your sentient part)), the
unconscious mind (your subconscious (whatever you want to call the part of your brain that's doing
stuff without your direct intervention)) as well as all other parts of the mind (I am not going to
bother enumerating them (it's a rather difficult task (one that I will likely make mistakes at (this
is assuming that I know (and I am rather certain that I do not know) what all the different parts
(assuming also that you want to break the mind into different parts (an assumption that I do not
want to make (I am only making this assumption here to illustrate a point (the point that I am
illustrating is that it is the whole mind that I am talking about)))) of the mind are)) and one that
I have no desire to perform) but will rather say that I mean the whole thing))))) but it will not be
the only focus of this document (I have a lot of things that I'd like to talk about (we'll get to
most of them eventually)))) (although it may be hard to follow at times (for which I
apologize))))).</p>
			<p>There are very few periods in this text (or punctuation marks other than
parentheses (I have already explained why (so I won't go into it any farther))) (this amuses me
quite a great deal and means that (in the technical sense) there are very few sentences).</p>
