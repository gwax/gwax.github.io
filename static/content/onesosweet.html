				Dearest little topic I do address.<br />
				Just so you know how correctly I chose,<br />
				To you I must be sure to do no less<br />
				Than all of my great love so true disclose.<br />
				Just as simple as one and one is two.<br />
				Akin to you there are none in all lands.<br />
				How I long to place my lips upon you.<br />
				Few things can compare to you in my hands.<br />
				Wondered have I, how without you I live.<br />
				Oft times have I shouted your name with glee.<br />
				There is joy to know how much you would give<br />
				Just to fill the void that is within me.<br />
				No greater delight than to snack on them.<br />
				How I love you, Glazed Entenmann's Popem.<br />
