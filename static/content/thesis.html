			<h2>Novel Potentials for the Simulation of Polyethylene and Other Polymeric Systems</h2>
			<p>As part of my degree requirement for a B.S. In Materials Science and Engineering, I was required to do an undergraduate thesis. I did my thesis on the topic of simulating polymers. You may read my thesis or see any of the various materials associated with it by clicking on the appropriate links below.</p>
			<p class="noindent"><a href="thesis/thesis.pdf">thesis.pdf</a> - The thesis itself, as presented to MIT on May 13th, 2005.</p>
			<p class="noindent"><a href="thesis/code/">code/</a> - All source code for the test implementation of the thesis methods.</p>
			<p class="noindent"><a href="thesis/videos/">videos/</a> - Various videos that were made from various simulation runs. The compression used is a mess and I appologize; some are DivX, some are MSmpeg4, some are mpeg2 and there may be others. Also, for the most part, the file naming scheme is gibberish.</p>
