That the United States, at one time, had an Emperor has recently come to
my attention. I find it rather interesting that history books tend to
neglect the reign of `Emperor Norton I <http://www.emperornorton.net>`__
when recounting American History. The more I read about this man, the
more exceptional he is, truly a great American and a patriot. I can
honestly say, with great conviction that Emperor Norton I is one of my
personal heroes.
