An Ode to One so Sweet
======================

:slug: onesosweet

| Dearest little topic I do address.
| Just so you know how correctly I chose,
| To you I must be sure to do no less
| Than all of my great love so true disclose.
|
| Just as simple as one and one is two.
| Akin to you there are none in all lands.
| How I long to place my lips upon you.
| Few things can compare to you in my hands.
|
| Wondered have I, how without you I live.
| Oft times have I shouted your name with glee.
| There is joy to know how much you would give
| Just to fill the void that is within me.
|
| No greater delight than to snack on them.
| How I love you, Glazed Entenmann's Popem.
