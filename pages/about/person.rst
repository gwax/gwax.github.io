Who am I?
---------

I'm a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area. My software contributions
are mostly closed source for my professional life or low profile. I have a
handful of small `projects <link://slug/projects>`_ and things to be found on
|github-icon| GitHub (`gwax <https://github.com/gwax>`__).  These days it would
probably be best to describe myself as a "data engineer"\ [#]_ but, in the
past, I've worked at just about every level of the stack.

.. [#] I often prefer to avoid the term "data engineer" because I feel it is
    often conflated with the concept of a DBA or a hands-off software
    "architect" role. Personally, I view a data engineer as just another
    hands-on software engineer that happens to spend more time dealing with
    data and backend data management than anything else.

Long ago, I graduated from `MIT <http://web.mit.edu/>`_ with a degree in
Materials Science and Engineering (course 3 to fellow alums). During my time at
MIT, I had a pretty strong focus on structural materials and computer
simulations of material behavior. Subsequent to graduating, I spent a number
of years\ [#]_ taking increasingly software-focused jobs but always trying to
keep my focus on math, science, or the like.

.. [#] Along the way to accepting that I was a software engineer, I took a
    brief detour to law school. I only made it through about three quarters of
    a year before I decided it wasn't for me. As such, I feel it's really more
    of a footnote issue than a body content matter.

I spent a number of years at a (now defunct) company called Archimedes, Inc.
writing software and simulating clinical trials. During that time, I managed
to develop a passion for healthcare technology. I've come and gone from the
healthcare technology field a few times\ [#]_.

.. [#] There are a **lot** of startups trying to operate in the healthcare
    technology space that do not have viable business models. A lot of the
    companies think they have viable business models but are wrong, very, very
    wrong.

Eventually, I ended up at `Google <https://www.google.com>`_ as a Datacenter
Software Engineer and couldn't really keep up the illusion that I was a
scientist that wrote software. It's for the best really, I like the
practicality of engineering. Working at Google was an enlightening experience
but, ultimately, there is a ceiling on the interest I can muster for tracking
networking equipment parts in a datacenter.

As of now, I am back in the rich data world of healthcare, working for
`Clover Health <https://www.cloverhealth.com/>`_, a startup health insurance
company, that also happens to be a technology company. We are trying to fix
healthcare for old people by bringing 21st century technology to the data,
operations, and managed care. It's hard, but I would love if we could do even
a little something to dent the massive problem that is modern healthcare.

If you want more professional details, there's something close enough to my
résumé available through LinkedIn. If you happen to want a proper résumé or
other details, you'll have to email me.

Non-professionally, I have a wife, a daughter, and a son, all of whom I love
to a degree that exceeds my writing ability to describe.

I am an avid player of `Magic: the Gathering <http://magic.wizards.com/>`_ and
many boardgames.

I also fancy myself an amateur mixologist.

Some day, I hope to master the Mai Tai.
