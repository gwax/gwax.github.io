      <description>&lt;p&gt;01:02:03 04/05/06 has just passed by us here in EDT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got the chance to realize that all of my Linux computers were set
to EST instead of EST5EDT (grumble, grumble).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lucky 33333 Fever</title>

      <description>&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://gwax.com/images/posts/Truck133333mi_200509131632.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="My truck's odometer hits 133333" class="align-right" src="https://gwax.com/images/posts/Truck133333mi_200509131632.thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday my truck's odometer read 33333 as it hit 133,333 miles (it has no
hundred thousands digit) and I took a photo of it. Sure it probably wasn't
safe taking a photo of my dash while driving, but I'm ok and with 3 being my
favorite number, it was worth the risk. I have included the photo for your
pleasure, the thumbnail links to the full image. It would have been nice if I
could have gotten 133,333.3, but there was too much glare and the photo didn't
come out. I'm pretty surprised at the quality my phone put out on this
one and completely unsurprised that the photo 0.3 miles later didn't
turn out at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the post title is a Final Fantasy VII reference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That the United States, at one time, had an Emperor has recently come to
my attention. I find it rather interesting that history books tend to
neglect the reign of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.emperornorton.net"&gt;Emperor Norton I&lt;/a&gt;
when recounting American History. The more I read about this man, the
more exceptional he is, truly a great American and a patriot. I can
honestly say, with great conviction that Emperor Norton I is one of my
personal heroes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
