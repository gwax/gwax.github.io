      <title>A cute geometry problem</title>
      <link>https://gwax.com/blog/2010/03/a-cute-geometry-problem.html</link>
      <dc:creator>George Leslie-Waksman</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came across a cute geometry problem recently and I would like to pass it
along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="problem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="problem-statement"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="row docutils container"&gt;
&lt;div class="four columns docutils container"&gt;
&lt;svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="u-max-full-width" viewbox="0 0 1 1"&gt;
    &lt;g stroke="black" stroke-width="0.005"&gt;
        &lt;rect x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;

        &lt;path fill="red" d="
            M 0.5 0.1339745962155614
            A 1 1, 0, 0, 1, 0.8660254037844386 0.5
            A 1 1, 0, 0, 1, 0.5 0.8660254037844386
            A 1 1, 0, 0, 1, 0.1339745962155614 0.5
            A 1 1, 0, 0, 1, 0.5 0.1339745962155614
            Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;

        &lt;path fill="none" d="M 0 0 A 1 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 1 L 1 0 Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;path fill="none" d="M 0 1 A 1 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 0 L 0 0 Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;path fill="none" d="M 1 1 A 1 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 0 L 0 1 Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;path fill="none" d="M 1 0 A 1 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 1 L 1 1 Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;/g&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="eight columns docutils container"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the sides of the square are of unit length and all curves are
circular arcs, what is the area of the highlighted region?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although substantially easier with the use of calculus or trigonometry,
this problem can be solved entirely with basic geometry (no weird laws
you might have forgotten since high school are necessary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have derived a geometric solution, which follows, but I highly
recommend trying to do it yourself first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gwax.com/blog/2010/03/a-cute-geometry-problem.html"&gt;Read moreâ€¦&lt;/a&gt; (2 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Chickens and Eggs</title>
      <link>https://gwax.com/blog/2005/04/chicken-and-egg.html</link>
      <dc:creator>George Leslie-Waksman</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok Internet, it's time we had a little discussion about the chicken and
the egg. There's a longstanding pseudo-philosophical debate as to which
came first: the chicken or the egg. The debate rests on two simple
principles: chickens come from chicken eggs and chicken eggs come from
chickens. The whole debate is wildly circular and people like to make it
analogous to other, (less pseudo-) philosophical debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, because this is a stupid argument, I'm going to set the record
straight. The egg came first. Now some people will launch into stupid
debate with me and say where did the egg come from and to these people I
say, learn some evolutionary biology. The current chicken generation
(generation n) hatched from eggs laid by the previous generation (n-1).
Generation n-1 hatched from eggs laid by generation n-2 and this goes
back for a long time. As you continue to go back, different varieties of
chicken converge and we find, for example, that the Bandara chicken came
originally from an egg that was laid by a White Cornish or by a
Gimmizah; in other words, the first Bandara egg was not laid by a
Bandara chicken. Just as Bandaras can be traced back to eggs that are
not their own, so too can chickens be traced back to an egg laid by some
pre-chicken creature. So there you have it, the egg came first, now shut
up about the damned chicken or egg debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will have to be noted that this solution is theoretical and that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i4/chicken_egg.html"&gt;experimental
tests&lt;/a&gt;
suggest that the chicken came first. Having run only one trial, the
results can not be guaranteed to be statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sidenote, the information about the Bandara chicken came from a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://afs.okstate.edu/breeds/poultry/chickens/chickens.html"&gt;Breeds of Chicken&lt;/a&gt;
site that google got me to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cellphone Numbers: Technological True Names</title>
      <link>https://gwax.com/blog/2004/12/cellphone-numbers-technological-true-names.html</link>
      <dc:creator>George Leslie-Waksman</dc:creator>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you unfamiliar with the concept of a true name, basically,
if you knew the true name of a spirit you could use it to invoke said
spirit and have power over said spirit. An example you may recognize is
that of Beetlejuice, saying the name "Beetlejuice" thrice invoked him or
dismissed him and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me recently that a cellphone number is very much
conceptually akin to the mystical concept of a true name. If you have
someone's cellphone number you can call them anywhere and theoretically
invoke them as well. You are granted power over an individual by being
able to contact them at any time. Also, just as with summoned demons, if
you invoke people for stupid reasons they will take it out on you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Nature of Free Time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It sometimes seems as though I never have free time when I want it and I
never want free time when I have it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
