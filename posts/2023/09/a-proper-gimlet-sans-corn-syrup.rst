A Gimlet is a refreshing cocktail with a subtle but distinct flavor profile. It
can be quite tasty but is very hard to get right without accepting an awful lot
of high fructose corn syrup. I tend to avoid high fructose corn syrup, so I
rarely make a proper Gimlet, but I've been experimenting with syrups over the
years and think I've struck on a pretty good alternative.

The Classic Gimlet
------------------

The starting point for a Gimlet is a simple mix of gin and `Rose's Lime Juice`_.
Sadly, Rose's is mostly water, high fructose corn syrup, and a little bit of
flavoring. It gives the right taste (tuotologically) but isn't something I feel
good about drinking.

Gimlet
^^^^^^

-   2 oz Gin
-   1 oz Rose's Lime Juice

Shake with ice and serve in a Nick and Nora glass.

The Gin Sour
------------

Commonly, one will find recipes calling for fresh lime juice an simple syrup.
While a good drink, the flavor profile is quite different from a true Gimlet.

Gin Sour
^^^^^^^^

-   2 oz Gin
-   3/4 oz Lime Juice
-   3/4 oz Simple Syrup

Shake with ice and serve in a Nick and Nora glass. Garnish with a lime slice.

Roll Your Own
-------------

From here, the path forward is to start trying to make your own lime syrup. The
first recipes that I tried were based on a simple syrup infused with lime
zest. This works well enough but the flavor is a bit too subtle and not quite
right.

From there, I largely set aside the matter until I came across a recipe trying
to `resurrect the original Rose's recipe <https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/15uki9f/resurrecting_the_original_taste_of_a_gimlet/jwpuyrz/>`_ on Reddit. To
my taste, the recipe is much to tart, more like a Sour Patch Kid than something
I want to use in drinks. That said, the flavor profile was in the right direction.

I played with the ratios and ended up with something that tastes really good to
my taste.

Key Lime Syrup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-   3/4 cup Water
-   1 1/2 cup white Sugar
-   1 oz Citric Acid
-   Zest of 11 key limes
-   Juice of 11 key limes

Put the sugar, citric acid, and key lime zest in a sauce pan. Add the water and
bring to a gentle boil. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat,
add the lime juice, cover, and let cool to room temperature. Strain through a
fine strainer (I use a nut milk bag) and bottle.

The Homemade Gimlet
-------------------

-   2 oz Gin
-   1 oz Key Lime Syrup

Shake with ice and serve in a Nick and Nora glass.

Delicious.
