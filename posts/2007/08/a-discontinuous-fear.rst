As I have progressed through my life I have become aware of various
phobias that exist in my psyche. Most of my phobias are perfectly
reasonable and I've managed to trace some of them back to childhood
traumas that likely seeded them. However, some of my phobias are
unreasonable and totally insane; for example, I have come to notice that
I have a fairly strong fear of temporal discontinuities. What I mean by
temporal discontinuities is unnoticed jumps far forward in time, kind of
like in the movie `Flight of the
Navigator <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Navigator>`__. I
don't know where the fear derives from and it's so thoroughly
implausible an occurrence that giving it even a hint of credence is
silly but it's still something that I fear.

Seriously though, I really hope that I never come back from a walk,
drive or sail to find my friends and family had long since given me up
for lost and that I must adjust to a world that has changed greatly
during my lost time.
