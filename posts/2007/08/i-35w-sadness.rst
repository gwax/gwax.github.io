The `I-35W
bridge <http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?formtype=address&address=I%2035w%20%26%20University%20Ave%20%20Se&city=Minneapolis&state=MN&zipcode=55401&country=US&geodiff=1>`__
across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, MN collapsed this morning.
I find myself more than a bit perturbed and irked by this tragedy; I've
driven across that bridge dozens of times and walked the Cedar Ave
Bridge (fifty feet to the East) hundreds of times. With all the friends
and family that I have in the Minneapolis area, I find myself hoping
that nobody I know was hurt. I am also terribly sorry for those that
have suffered losses as a result of this tragedy, either personally or
through friends and family.
