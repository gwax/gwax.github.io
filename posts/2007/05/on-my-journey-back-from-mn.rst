Since I returned to Massachusetts and got my computer set up, I've been
meaning to write about my trip back from Minnesota. As time goes by, I
see that as less and less likely to happen so, instead, I will give you
a very brief summary so that the important points can be touched upon.

Having made only a few hours of headway, my clutch decided to wear out
20 miles north of Madison, WI. This was incredibly unpleasant, requiring
that I be towed to Madison to have my clutch completely replaced. As bad
as it was, my clutch going was not all bad; I was able to reacquaint
myself with my old friend Amrys, whom I had not seen in far too long and
who happens to currently be living in Madison. Amrys was friendly enough
to provide me with company, a couch to crash on and a brief overview of
Madison, including an introduction to a quite pleasant breakfasterie. My
car was fixed by noon the day after it broke and I was able to get
underway once more. The car provided no more problems from that point.

On leaving Minnesota, I had commenced listening to Frank Herbert's Dune
in audio book format, which is a monstrously long audio endeavor. The
second leg of the Journey took me to Ithaca, NY and I was only just
finishing Dune shortly before I arrived. Now, I must say, as a way to
entertain myself during 17-19 hours of driving, listening to Dune served
fantastically well. Listening to Dune kept my attention so well that I
didn't, even once, find myself bored by the driving and completely
failed to notice Ohio, even though receipts clearly show that I stopped
in Ohio.

I stopped in Ithaca, NY so that I might be able to visit with a few
friends that I have who attend Cornell. Over the course of one day and
two nights, I spent some time hanging out with my friend Liz, some time
hanging out with my friend Hannah and, in 45 minutes time, picked up a
sunburn. How white must I be to get a sunburn from 45 minutes of New
York state, early May sun. It was a good time, which was followed by the
final leg of my journey, the Ithaca, NY to Concord, MA stretch.

The Ithaca, NY to Concord, MA leg of the journey was pretty much
uneventful and filled with the fantastically amusing audio book
rendition of The Areas Of My Expertise by John Hodgman. I would like to
go on record highly recommending The Areas Of My Expertise.

There you have it, a brief summary of my pilgrimage back from Minnesota.
