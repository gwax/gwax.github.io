I have now officially (although there is nothing actually official about
it) moved down to Woods Hole, MA (Cape Cod) for the summer. This marks
the earliest that I have ever transferred myself to Woods Hole for a
summer and, as such, there are very few people here. Also, sadly, it's
still a bit too cold for swimming or matters nautical (sailing).
Thankfully, it's still quite pleasant in the way that Woods Hole always
is and there are enough people that I'm not bored out of my skull. It's
nice to be back.

Oh, and if any of you folks want to drop in for a while, feel free.
