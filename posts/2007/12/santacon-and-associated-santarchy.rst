This past Saturday, I attended what is probably the finest event that I
have ever had the pleasure of attending, even topping `drunken cowboy
faires <http://blog.gwax.com/2006/09/03/ye-olde-cowboy/>`__. This past
Saturday was San Francisco's
`SantaCon <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SantaCon>`__ (aka. Santarchy),
which after having heard good tales from Zoz years back and being
reminded by a coworker a couple weeks ago, I managed to `track
down <http://sanfranciscosantarchy.wordpress.com/>`__ (also available in
many `other cities <http://santarchy.com/>`__).

The basic idea of SantaCon is simple, get dressed up as Santa or
something similarly
`Chrishanukkwanzaastice <http://blog.gwax.com/2006/12/26/merry-chrishanukkwanzaastice/>`__
themed, meet up with a a few similarly dressed up folks and proceed to
have a merry time. There are, some nuanced details that make it all the
more entertaining, for example, it's more like a few hundred other
people, you're gallivanting around an unsuspecting city and you're all
consuming copious quantities of alcohol. By my best estimates, there
were somewhere between 800 and 1500 Santas & co. that eventually became
split between San Francisco and the East Bay. I ended up with the East
Bay contingent, quite successfully running amok about Jack London Square
and, subsequently, other parts of downtown Oakland. There is really no
way that I can properly describe the scene that is half a thousand
rampaging Santas; it is both one of the greatest things that I have ever
seen and one of the greatest things that I have ever been a part of.

It is my absolute intention to attend SantaCons wherever I may happen to
be when they happen in the future and I absolutely recommend that the
rest of you do the same. Heck, all the cool kids are doing it.
