I have just tendered my withdrawal from law school. The short of why is
that it is just not me; the long of why is long and I might get into it
later, or I might not. I will be moving back to Massachusetts in short
order and, from there, I will figure out what next for my life.

Whilst, on one hand, coming to law school was a mistake, on the other,
it has provided me with interesting experiences and a deeper
understanding of my personal tastes. I have also made good friends here
that I hope not to lose contact with simply because I am leaving the
geographical area. I will greatly miss the people that I am leaving
behind but I will not miss attending law school or paying for law
school. Perhaps it is best for me to say that going to law school was a
mistake, but a mistake that I do not regret making.
