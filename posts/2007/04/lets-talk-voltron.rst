Ok, Internet, I know we've been doing a poor job staying in touch with
each other lately and I don't really feel like pointing fingers, so
let's put that behind us. After all, right now, I have something
important that I want to talk about: Voltron. In my random being up
late, eating a snack and watching some television, I happened to partake
in a rerun of Voltron on Adult Swim. This rerun led me to a couple of
realizations, which I would like to share with you. Realization 1: the
Power Rangers were the biggest ripoff of Voltron anyone could have
possibly perpetrated; seriously, Power Rangers would have been more
aptly titled *Voltron: The Live Action Series*. Realization 2: Voltron
was a terrible show; don't get me wrong, The Transformers was only 90%
as glorious rewatching it in my 20s as it was before I was 10 but
Voltron, rewatched in my 20s, is terrible. Internet, if you have fond
memories of Voltron, please, take my advice don't ever watch it again;
let your fond memories remain unclouded for the product itself will fail
to deliver.
