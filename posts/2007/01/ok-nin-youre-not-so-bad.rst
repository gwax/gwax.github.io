For quite a long time, I've been of the rather firm negative opinion
that Nine Inch Nails (NIN) was a semi-decent industrial-rock group that
was substantially inferior to KMFDM and others of the genre. However, I
was in a bit of a crummy mood earlier this eve—a situation that I often
respond to by listening to angry metal or industrial music—and all the
other bands that I tried weren't quite fitting my mood, so I decided to
try putting some NIN on the good ol' Winamp. It turned out the be the
case that NIN was precisely the music that I needed to fit the mood that
I was in and, I can now say, I am willing to accept NIN as a perfectly
valid and viable industrial-rock option in and of itself. NIN has carved
out it's own niche within my musical desires and tastes; it has, so to
speak, gained a place in my musical pantheon alongside its
contemporaries, the likes of KMFDM, PIG and Skinny Puppy.
