Today marks the third anniversary of `this blog's
inception <http://blog.gwax.com/2004/01/04/fp/>`__. Fancy that, I've
been spewing crap onto the internet for three whole years; go me! I
don't know that I'm contributing more to the internet than
this-one-quirky-guy-who's-done-some-stuff's opinion but I was never
promising much more than that and I like to think that the
this-one-quirky-guy-who's-done-some stuff is a lot interesting than many
of those people that have converted myspace and livejournal into
festering hives of angst. Heck, without this blog we wouldn't have ever
seen the likes of my solution for `stuck LCD
pixels <http://blog.gwax.com/2006/01/03/unsticking-stuck-lcd-pixels/>`__
or my answer to the `chicken and egg
debate <http://blog.gwax.com/2005/04/14/chicken-and-egg/>`__ (my records
show that you people really dig these things). Anyway, happy third
anniversary my blog and thanks to all my readers for, well, reading.

Oh, and it's the magical anniversary because three is the magical
number. I mean, surely you've read fairy tales. Right? Anyway, magical
or whatever, three is my favorite number so it's still special.
