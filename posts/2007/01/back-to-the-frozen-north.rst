Today, I return to Minnesota in preparation for law school semester two.
In some ways, I'm glad to be going back but in other ways, I'm very sad
to be leaving. Seeing people in Massachusetts again has reminded me of
how much I miss some of my very good friends and that makes leaving
again harder in some ways. At the same time though, there are friends in
Minnesota that it will be nice to get back to. Additionally, there's my
inactivity and other matters that I would like to replace with law
school workload. Going back to Minnesota carries some pretty mixed
feelings for me but such is life, mine at least.
