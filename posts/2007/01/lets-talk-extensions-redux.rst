I'm still (surprise, surprise) using `Mozilla
Firefox <http://www.mozilla.com/>`__ as my primary web browser and I
continue to recommend it as the finest browser that I am aware of. A bit
over a year ago, I suggested `a bunch of
extensions <link://slug/lets-talk-extensions>`__
for use with Firefox; today I do the same. In the intervening time, many
new versions of Firefox have come and gone and my needs in extensions
have changed. Here's an updated list:

-  `BetterSearch <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/211>`__
   - provides thumbnails in google search results; sometimes it's the
   little things
-  `Bookmark Sync and
   Sort <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2367>`__ -
   allows the synchronization of bookmarks from multiple computers
   through an ftp or WebDAV http/https store; essential for anyone with
   more than one computer
-  `BugMeNot <http://roachfiend.com/archives/2005/02/07/bugmenot/>`__ -
   bypasses many website registrations; I really hate those compulsory
   registrations
-  `ChatZilla <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/16>`__ -
   IRC client; sometimes you just need an IRC client
-  `Colorful
   Tabs <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1368>`__ -
   colorizes my tabs; another one of those little things that sometimes
   it's
-  `Download
   Statusbar <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/26>`__ -
   moves download status from the download manager to the bottom of your
   browser window; the download manager annoys me
-  `DownThemAll! <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/201>`__
   - download all files from a page; sometimes you just need all the
   files
-  `ErrorZilla
   Mod <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3336>`__ -
   replaces the failed to load page with a more useful one; yeah, more
   useful
-  `Execute JS <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1729>`__
   - execute arbitrary javascript or inject it into pages; sometimes you
   just need a little more javascript
-  `Fasterfox <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1269>`__ -
   speeds up and optimizes page loading; faster is better after all
-  `Firesomething <http://www.gwax.com/information/files/firesomething-1.7.0-fx-updated.xpi>`__
   - rebrands Firefox wrong; Mozilla Taconarwhal never gets old
-  `Fission <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951>`__ -
   puts a loading bar in the address bar; yeah, another one of those
   little things
-  `Greasemonkey <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748>`__
   - allows for the use of custom user scripts (many of which are
   `freely available <http://userscripts.org/>`__); so much
   customization, so great

   -  (script) `Amazon DRM
      Notifier <http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/3863>`__ - lets you
      know if a CD on Amazon is infected with DRM; I hate crippleware
      and want nothing to do with it
   -  (script) `facebook aim status
      icon <http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/3676>`__ - tells you if
      a person in facebook is currently online with AIM; marginally
      useful information but I am a fan of information overload
   -  (script) `Facebook Flyer
      Remover <http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/5555>`__ - gets rid
      of ads in Facebook; yeah, I still hate ads
   -  (script) `Facebook
      StalkrNET <http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/3676>`__ - relabels
      every instance of the name Facebook to StalkrNET; everyone uses it
      for stalking, why not call it like it is
   -  (script) `Westlaw
      Title <http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/5617>`__ - puts the
      title of a found article in the title bar when using Westlaw;
      makes my law school research slightly easier
   -  (script) `Westlaw
      Window <http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/5578>`__ - prevents
      Westlaw from creating a whole bunch of unneeded windows; makes my
      law school research less annoying

-  `Hit-a-Hint <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1341>`__
   - press H or hold Spacebar and all links on the page get a number,
   type the number to select the link; sometimes the mouse just slows
   you down
-  `Html
   Validator <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/249>`__ -
   puts an icon showing whether a page is valid HTML in the status bar;
   I'm a stickler for valid HTML and I like to know when a page passes
   or why it's failing to validate
-  `Link Alert <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3199>`__
   - tells me what sort of thing a link is linking to; these kinds of
   things can be good to know something
-  `NoScript <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722>`__ -
   disables javascript and flash by default, allows whitelists; gets rid
   of so many ads and so much annoyance
-  `ShowIP <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/590>`__ -
   shows the IP address for and provides information about a page in the
   status bar; marginally useful information but I kind of like it
-  `Tab Mix
   Plus <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122>`__ -
   improves tab functionality substantially; seriously, Tab Mix Plus
   makes tabs so much better
