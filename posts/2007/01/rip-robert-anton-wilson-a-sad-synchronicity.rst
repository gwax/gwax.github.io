Today, marks both the 101st birthday of Dr. Albert Hofmann and the day
that Robert Anton Wilson died. Dr. Albert Hofmann is the scientist who
first synthesized LSD in 1938 and discovered its powerful psychoactive
properties as a result of a laboratory accident in 1943. Robert Anton
Wilson was an author, philosopher, advocate for drug law reform and a
prominent Discordian. Robert Anton Wilson co-wrote the Illuminatus
Trilogy, a series of books that I consider to be one of the most
entertaining things that I have ever read. I am saddened by the death of
Robert Anton Wilson and find the coincidence with Dr. Albert Hofmann's
birthday to be a curious synchronicity.

Happy birthday Doctor Hofmann.

Goodbye Mr. Wilson and thank you for what you have given our world. All
hail Eris.
