Interesante. I don't really care too much about playing video back using
my Xbox 360 just yet, but I think there's a couple of projects out there
trying to reverse-engineer the file-sharing protocol. It'd be nice to be
able to use a Linux machine to do all the filesharing...

Do you have an Xbox Live account?
