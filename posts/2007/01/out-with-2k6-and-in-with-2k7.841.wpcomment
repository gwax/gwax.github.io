i highly recommend TCFC. it's where my friend fences and the instructors
are awesome. the space might not be as large as you're used to, but it's
fine for the people that fence there and you are in the midwest, after
all. also, they have a really good sabre instructor, which is what you
enjoy, i believe. if you want more information, i can have my friend
contact you. he's groovy.
