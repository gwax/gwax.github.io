I recently came across a trailer for the movie `Land of the
Blind <http://imdb.com/title/tt0433405/>`__ at the beginning of some DVD
or other. Strangely, prior to the trailer, I hadn't heard hide nor hair
of Land of the Blind. Anyway, working on the premise that the preview
seemed mighty neat, I set about finding an opportunity to watch it.
Having now watched this film, I have to say that I can't understand why
it didn't show up on the radar. Land of the Blind flew so low that there
are only 17 reviews of it aggregated on `Rotten
Tomatoes <http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10006782-land_of_the_blind/>`__
(as opposed to the more common 200ish).

Anyway, Land of the Blind follows a political revolution in a
totalitarian state, from the standpoint of a military underling that
befriends the head of the revolution. The movie starts out kind of
normal and political but then descends into bizarre and political before
finally descending into crazy and confusing. Basically, I feel Land of
the Blind has been done a terrible injustice and in order to rectify the
matter I am recommending it to you folks. If you're my friend, you'll
probably like it (Sherv, Riad, it's right up your alleys).
