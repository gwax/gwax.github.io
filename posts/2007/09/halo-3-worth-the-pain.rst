Halo 3 came out for the Xbox 360 on Tuesday and it's awesome. On account
of Halo 3, I've been going to sleep at about 2am for the past three
nights, which wouldn't be so bad if I didn't also have to wake up for
work at about 6am. That said, it's totally worth the unpleasantness of
not sleeping enough. Sure, it's more Halo and not altogether too
revolutionary but, it **IS** more Halo, it is prettier Halo with cooler
weapons and vehicles. Basically, Halo was already King of console FPSes
and Halo 3 is just coming in and saying, "hey, I'm taking over for my
dad so sit down because you know your place!"
