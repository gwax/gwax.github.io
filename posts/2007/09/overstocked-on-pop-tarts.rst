Much like the Chance card where there's a "Bank error in your favor",
there's been a Kellogg's error in my favor. Unfortunately, the Kellogg's
error gave me a free pop-tart and not $200. Then there are the added
facts that I don't really want 3 pop-tarts and they're free workplace
pop-tarts to begin with. Still, I'm amused that they accidentally put
three pop-tarts in a two-pack; I wonder if, somewhere out there, someone
is missing a pop-tart.
