I happen to have a friend that works for
`Harmonix <http://www.harmonixmusic.com/>`__, creators of Guitar Hero I
& II, which provided me a unique opportunity earlier today (technically
yesterday). I got a chance to play a development version of Harmonix's
upcoming game `Rock Band <http://www.rockband.com/>`__ for a couple
hours and, I have to say, it is awesome, really awesome. I had to sign a
NDA so I am not allowed to tell you anything else about it but,
seriously, Rock Band is awesome. Now, it's time for me to settle in and
wait for the game to actually be released.
