In spite of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, four Soviet
states still exist today. Although none of the four states have obtained
international recognition and have all been disavowed by Moscow, they
are all de facto independent states.

`Transnistria <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria>`__, a.k.a.
Trans-Dniester or Pridnestrovie, exists within the international
recognized borders of Moldova. Transnistria currently exists in a state
of civil war with the rest of Moldova and is bordered by the Dniester
River on the west and the Ukraine on the east.

`Nagorno-Karabakh <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh>`__
exists in the South Caucasus region of Azerbaijan. Unlike Transnistria,
Nagorno-Karabakh has been participating in peace talks with both
Azerbaijan and Armenia, never having escalated into open warfare.

The final two Soviet states,
`Abkhazia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abkhazia>`__ and `South
Ossetia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia>`__ exist within the
borders of Georgia. There has been open warfare between Georgia and both
South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
