Soul Calibur IV has been announced for the Xbox 360 and PS3. For those
of you that know me and my preferences in video games, you might have
some idea of how very excited I am right now. For those of you that
don't know my fondness for the series, suffice it to say that I am very
excited. Furthermore, for those that didn't catch the reference,
HUGLAGHALGHALGHAL is taken from `Jerk City <http://jerkcity.wang/>`__ (a
puerile, offensive, not safe for work comic that I don't recommend
anybody read).
