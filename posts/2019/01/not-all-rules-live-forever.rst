At some point in high school, while gallivanting around New England on
inexpensive gasoline and end of the day donuts some random guy at Dunkin'
Donuts gave us on the cheap, I developed my first set of canonical rules to
live by:

1.  When you're chucking a danish, everything's a cop car.
2.  When in doubt, go left.
3.  When in doubt, buy double.

These were born empirically from the demands of the time. A few years later,
an addition was made:

4.  Even floors do not exist.

This rule was born from spite and soon after another rule was introduced to
provide a loophole:

5.  Apathy is the lazy man's whatever.

Spite and loopholes aren't really good ways to build a morality or worldview
so I am retiring rules #4 and #5.
