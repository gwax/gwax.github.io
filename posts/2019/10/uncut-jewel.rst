Once a year, I take a month off from Caffeine and Alcohol (sometimes I'll throw
in something else like high fructose corn syrup). It was fairly arbitrary for
a number of years but now, having learned it's kind of a thing, I tend to
take my temperance in January. This time around, I've moved things up a few
months and am abstaining in October.

Giving up booze, even temporarily, doesn't mean that I want to give up
cocktails. Turns out, however, it's really hard to make something without
alcohol that doesn't end up tasting like juice or flavored water. Seedlip_
is meant for this purpose and helps some but tends to fall pretty easily into
the juice or flavored water trap.

Through a mix of experimenting, Seedlip_ recipe ideas, `Aviary Cocktail Book`_
inspiration, staring at my liquor shelf, and starting at my fridge, I've had a
modicum of success. I seem to have hit on a formula that works well stirred
with ice and served Up:

A Non-Alcoholic Up formula
--------------------------

-   1 oz Seedlip (Spice 94 or Garden 108)
-   1/2 oz Verjus Blanc (Fusion Napa Valley)
-   1/2 oz Verjus Rouge (Fusion Napa Valley)
-   1/2 oz Cranberry Juice
-   1/2 oz Syrup (Simple, Demerara, etc.)
-   1-2 dash(es) bitters

Gomme Syrup and Garden 108 seem to work well together but I think the best
that I've hit on so far is what I'm calling an Uncut Jewel:

Uncut Jewel recipe
------------------

-   1 oz Seedlip Spice 94
-   1/2 oz Verjus Blanc (Fusion Napa Valley)
-   1/2 oz Verjus Rouge (Fusion Napa Valley)
-   1/2 oz Cranberry Juice
-   1/2 oz Maple Syrup (Grade A Amber Color, Rich Taste)
-   1 dash Salted Cacao Bitters (Workhorse Rye + Dandelion Chocolate)

Stir with ice, serve up, and garnish with a Maraschino cherry.

Notes
-----

The drink leads with a note of allspice before taking on dominant notes of
fruit and nuts and finally closes with a hint of cocoa. Overall, it's well
balanced, sippable, and fairly complex, without assaulting the palette.
