I have returned to the world of the people that I know; aka.
Cambridge-ish, MA (namely Concord, MA, which is 30 minutes from
Cambridge). Having returned, things are going to be back to a funny
variant of what they were before my departure at the end of June.
Anyway, long story short, I'm back to the world of off-Cape, hope y'all
are glad to have me back.
