I need to do a bit of work on my truck as soon as the weather will allow
it (damned rain). The big thing that I need to do are get under my truck
and check that the oil filter and oil pan drain plug are tightened
sufficiently; I seem to have developed a slow oil leak since I changed
my oil, which makes them my prime suspects. Beyond that, I'm pretty sure
that I need to change my brake pads (I really hope that I have rear disc
brakes and don't have to deal with drums). After that, I'm going to make
a check of all my fluid levels and go back to waiting for enough money
to change my tires. I'll probably fiddle around with things a bit too,
just for fun.

For those of you that are concerned, these are minor issues I can deal
with myself, except the tires, that I need money for. Soon I get work,
then I get tires, that's the plan. Until then, I've got a spare so I'm
ok if anything goes wrong (except for a high-speed blow-out).

And yes, I am phrasing things to incite you.

Beat up old cars are great.
