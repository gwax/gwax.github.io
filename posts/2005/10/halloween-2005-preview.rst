|Boximus Prime Preview 1| |Boximus Prime Preview 2| Halloween is coming
on quickly and I have decided to go and make myself a fancy costume this
year. Shortly after waking up today I went and obtained some of the
materials that I need and spent much of the afternoon/early evening
working on my costume. I kept working until I ran out of packing tape
and will pick up where I left off after a trip to the store tomorrow.
With luck I will be well prepared for any Halloween parties I attend
this weekend. Included are some previews images of my costume; it's more
impressive than it looks.
