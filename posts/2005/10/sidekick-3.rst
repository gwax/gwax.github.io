I was at the Burlington mall for a while yesterday to get some brake
work done on my truck and I stopped by at one of the T-Mobile booths to
get my Sidekick's hip holster replaced. The guy at the booth didn't have
any holsters and claimed that the Sidekick 2 has been recalled because
they plan to release the Sidekick 3 before Christmas. The guy went
further to say that the Sidekick 3 will have Bluetooth support and run
some form of Windows. Now all the thing needs is GPS and it'd be the
ideal mobile device, in my opinion. Anyway, it looks like I'll probably
be upgrading my phone, GPS or no.
