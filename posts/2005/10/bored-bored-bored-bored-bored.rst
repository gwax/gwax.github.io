I knew it was going to happen and I'm sure spending September watching
television didn't help, I'm tired of doing nothing. Truth be told, I'm
kind of surprised that it happened so quickly, I was expecting it to
take another week or so. So, what am I going to do about it you might
ask, yeah me too. Well, I've already begun turning the slow wheels
towards getting myself a job to make money for now, but I doubt that
will do everything I need. I've started working on turning the Silly
Clown Joke into an unnecessarily long story in writing, which makes for
one side project. I'm also reading up to try and get better at Go, a
side-effect of the fact that Go seems to be getting popular around my
parts of Senior House and I'm not any good at the game. Maybe I should
find myself a girlfriend who I can pay a lot of attention to in order to
pass the time and amuse myself. I expect that I'll probably find some
way to keep myself entertained, and the longer I take finding it, the
harder I'll be looking.
