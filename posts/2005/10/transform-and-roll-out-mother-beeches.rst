I have now obtained Transformers: Season 2, Part 2, thus completing my
collection of Transformers cartoons. This can be described as a
successful accomplishment of one of my life goals. Money can't buy
happiness, but it can buy things that bring happiness.

He he, Megatron just lifted Lincoln out of the chair at his memorial and
used it as a throne. Now it's Dinobot smashing time, hooray! Oh man,
this is going to make my being unemployed just that much more fun.
