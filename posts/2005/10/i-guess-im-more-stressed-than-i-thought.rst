Just as I would expect of myself, I'm annoyed with my previous post and
want to find some way to back-pedal, take it all back and pretend
everything is fine but I don't think that I will. Although, I would
prefer if I had maintained my cool whilst writing that post, though I
don't think I would have been able to bring myself to write something
like that if I did maintain my cool. I guess that I'll go with, oh well,
cat's out of the bag; I'm incredibly stressed out right now. A good,
long night of sleep seems to have done wonders as far as getting me back
stable and stuff but most of what I said is still true, just buried
again. It's kind of funny, I'm more stressed out having nothing to do
than having way too much to do. For all of you people that I know who
are still in school, let me recommend trying to figure out what you're
going to do next while you're still there.

I can only remember two other times that I've been this stressed out.
The first would be during the my breakup with my first girlfriend; I
attribute much of the stress to my inexperience and adolescent hormones
but it still hurt a bunch and cut real deep. The other is shortly after
I broke my shoulder when it actually hit me that I wouldn't be able to
use my arm for over a month and I might have caused irreparable damage
to myself; I still favor my right arm a little. This means that two of
the three most stressful times of my life have been within the past few
months, fancy that.
