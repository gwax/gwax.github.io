It was looking to be dry enough to do a bit of truck work so I set about
doing so. First things first, I hopped under my truck and checked that
the oil filter and oil pan drain plug were nice and tight; they were.
Having checked my prime leak suspects, I checked my oil level, seemed
fine, which leads me to wonder if I just under-filled it earlier, which
is what I'm going to assume for now because I'm lazy and that's the
easiest assumption to deal with. Then I checked to see if my rear brakes
are drum or disc; they're drum brakes (grumble grumble). I'm not the big
fan of replacing drum brakes, because it's a bit more effort consuming
than replacing disc brakes, so I came up with a brilliant idea to get
around the matter and get my tires replaced. Since I have been paying
for my car insurance, and saving my parents a pretty penny, I thought I
might see if I could talk my mom into springing to pay for replacing my
tires and brakes. I figured that it would probably cost me on the order
of $300 in parts and $400 all told, because that's about what it would
cost for the same operations on all previous cars I'd dealt with and my
mom seemed amenable to the idea, so I set off for Sears Auto Center to
see about getting it all taken care of. Sadly, it turns out, Ford
Explorer parts are about twice as expensive as Honda Accord or Toyota
Corolla parts and replacing my tires and brakes will be a bit over $600
in parts and about $700 all told. $700 being rather a good bit more than
$300-$400, pretty well derails my plans for brakes and tires and puts me
back at waiting until I have some money of my own before dealing with
anything on my truck.

However, I did just get a paycheck that I'd forgotten to expect...
