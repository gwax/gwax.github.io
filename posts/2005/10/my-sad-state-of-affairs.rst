Hysteria has no place here.

This post was as an angry e-mail, it should have been left unposted,
reread in the morning and deleted. After deletion, a better message with
the same content and no histeria should have replaced it.

Suffice it to say, I am fairly lonely and incredibly bored and a minor
event triggered a hysteric outburst. At the time the intent was one of
trying to reaffirm my existence and draw attention from friends. Many
details and elements of the post were blown out of proportion and
exaggerated in my self-pity.

So yeah, being unemployed, without direction and stuck at home is taking
a rather hefty emotional toll on me and any sympathy people can offer me
would be appreciated.
