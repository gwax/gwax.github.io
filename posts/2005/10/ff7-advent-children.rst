Earlier tonight I watched through Square/Enix's latest movie offering,
Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and I was touched in more ways than a
molested child. This movie is everything that someone who enjoyed Final
Fantasy VII could possibly want in a SquareSoft movie, everything. If
you played Final Fantasy VII as much as I did (or like many people, more
than I did), you will find the movie's continuation of the plot and
general feel of Final Fantasy VII to be wonderful and you will see that
they have carried over a spectacular number of details from the game
(look at the things people do in combat). If you aren't so well versed
in the world of Final Fantasy VII, you will find this movie to be a
fairly cryptic and bizarre movie with incredibly awesome battle
sequences. I had expected greatness from this movie the moment I heard
it would come to be and yet it still managed to exceed my expectations
by a bunch. Also, unlike actually being molested, I'm not going to
repress watching this movie and then have to talk to a psychologist
about it in 30 years.
