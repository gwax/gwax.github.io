A number of people have recently expressed interest in hanging out with
me now that I'm back in the vicinity of Cambridge so I thought that it
might be about time to remind people of how very easy it is to get me to
hang out. Normally I maintain a pretty sparse schedule but since I'm
currently unemployed (which for some reason I really enjoy saying right
now), I'm keeping a nearly empty schedule. To hang out with me one need
simply find a place where I'm already hanging out or get me to come to
wherever one is, both of which are easy tasks, which I will explain how
to accomplish. In order to find a place where I am already hanging out,
I highly recommend calling my cell phone and asking me but, beyond that,
when I'm not at home, I am usually in Destiny Kitchen or 433. As for
getting me to come hang out with you, just tell me where and when (you
can schedule me in as far in advance as you like--first come, first
serve--but for more than a couple days, you'll probably have to remind
me); the best ways to tell me are call my cell phone, AIM me or e-mail
me. As far as getting a hold of me, I should add the caveats that I
don't get cell reception at home and I'm not AIMable or quick to respond
to e-mail when I'm asleep. Worst case, leave me a voicemail and I'll get
back to you next time I have reception. In general, I need about 5
minutes notice if I'm in the city or 30 minutes notice if I'm at home.

If you don't know my cell phone number, AIM username or e-mail address,
ask me next time you see me or post a comment on this post.
