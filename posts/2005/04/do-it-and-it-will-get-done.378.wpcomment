LaTeX isn't exactly thesis writing software...

It's a typesetting system that works damn well for writing
science-related topics. Have you ever tried inserting equations into
Word? \*shudder\* Things like LaTeX can be a pain, because you don't get
to see what you're typing, but once you get the hang of it, it's really
convenient.
