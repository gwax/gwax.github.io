It appears to be the case that CalTech is taking up a `pranking
war <http://www.caltechvsmit.com/>`__ against MIT. This reminds me of
the various college rivalries that I am aware of: CalTech has a rivalry
with MIT, MIT has a rivalry with Harvard, Harvard has a rivalry with
Yale and Yale has a rivalry with Harvard. Save for the Harvard/Yale
rivalry, these rivalries are one sided and the target generally doesn't
care about the instigator. As far as I know, Harvard thinks they're
better than MIT and doesn't care enough to bother with us and the same
is true for us and CalTech.

I'm speaking largely from my own experience and it may very well be the
case that CalTech may be able to inspire some MIT students to react and
the rivalry may become two sided. Personally, I find it rather childish
but I am still mildly curious to see what will happen with this whole
affair.
