I have constructed a new composition and I have entitled it
`in(s)anity <http://www.gwax.com/content/in(s)anity.html>`__. The title
is supposed to point to the fact that it's inane, insane, inanely insane
and insanely inane. It's a bit of a stream of consciousness work and I
think that it's one of my best yet.
