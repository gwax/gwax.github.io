I have reached a new culinary extreme (new low or new high) with my
dinner tonight. Tonight's meal is a can of refried beans (heated) with
shredded cheese and a Barq's root beer. One might think it easy to call
this a lowly meal but it took me 3 minutes to make, cost less than $2,
gave me my RDA of fiber, gave me about 30g of protein and tasted pretty
decent.

Ok, I guess a can of refried beans is not a culinary anything, it's more
of a hobo food. However, on my continued bachelor chow search, it's a
pretty decent component option.
