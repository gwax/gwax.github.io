It turns out that I did not get into the one graduate school that I
applied to. I guess this means that I counted my eggs before they
hatched, which makes it good that I'm a mammal and my species bears live
young. This means that I am now roughly two months from freedom and not
knowing what I'm going to be doing in the future; it's actually a kind
of nice feeling.
