One should really not underestimate the value of good staples.
Technically, the value is about $4.18 per 5000 staples or $0.000836 per
staple, but it's not the monetary value we're concerned with. It's the
time/effort/life value of good staples that matters. The particular
staples, Swingline S.F.4 Premium Staples, are more uniform and have
slightly sharper tips thus making them staple paper more easily and with
less frequent mis-staplings. All of you out there using standard quality
staples are really missing out.
