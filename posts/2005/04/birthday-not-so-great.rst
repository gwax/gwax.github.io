Well, today was my birthday; I'm 22 now, and I've been sick since
sometime last week. I was originally planning on setting up some sort of
dinner thing for last Friday but somehow I became completely incapable
of sending e-mail to the people I wanted to send e-mail to, which turned
out to be for the best because I was getting too sick by Friday evening
to have done anything with anyone. I spent the weekend running a
moderate fever and lying in bed. The Liz came over and force fed me
water and Tylenol while we watched movies and TV shows on my computer.
In the end, I spent most of my birthday in bed, watching the BBC show
Coupling, dehydrated and with poor body temperature control.

Whatever, I'm 22 now and I've got a bottle full of penicillin, so
hopefully I'll be ok in a little while.
