About 30 minutes ago, I finished my first draft of my thesis and sent a
copy to my my thesis advisor. I'm quite pleased and my relaxed state has
very little to do with my celebratory White Russian. The biggest step in
project Dig Myself Out of my Workload is now complete and I plan to get
a good night's sleep.

Just to help clarify how pleased and relaxed I am, I have put about 50
hours of work into this thing since Thursday afternoon (ie. ~12.5h/day
for four days).
