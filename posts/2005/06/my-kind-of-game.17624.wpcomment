> If I could manage to get a Double Fanucci deck, it might be interesting
to try to construct rules but, until then, thereâ€™s not much to be done
with regards to Double Fanucci.

I know, it's been ages since you posted this, but you can now get a
Fanucci deck. Through the magic of modern science I've been able to
publish a version of the Fanucci deck I made for myself a few years ago.
