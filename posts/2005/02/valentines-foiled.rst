The Liz totally figured out my cinder block plan before I could give her
one. Having had my plans foiled, I shall have to fall back to giving her
something else and then telling her the story of why I was going to give
her a cinder block. Maybe this'll teach me to post `my evil
schemes <link://slug/my-valentines-day>`__ on my
blog (but probably not).

I am further foiled by having a whole ton and a half of stuff to do
today. Between my normal Monday stuff and having a big problem set due
tomorrow, I am too busy for Valentine's day. Luckily, I will make up for
this deficiency by spending time with the Liz tomorrow.

**Note:** There are two people named Liz linked to from my blog; I am
dating the one listed as "the Liz" (Sherv brought this ambiguity to my
attention).
