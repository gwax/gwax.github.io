I spent this past weekend in Ithaca, NY visiting Liz at Cornell. Ellen
and I drove out late Friday and came back mid-Sunday. It was very chill
and we didn't do much but it was a good change of scenery and company,
which pleased me. I'm pretty sure that a good time was had by all. And
I'm being lazy, so that's all the blog updating that you get for now.
