Well, today is the first day of classes of my last semester as an
undergraduate and this is also my 200th post.

This leaves two things to discuss and I'll start with the 200th post
bit. 200 posts, hooray! Ok, that'll do for that.

So, first day of classes, I guess that I might as well give a bit of a
preview of what this term is going to look like for me. I've got my
schedule narrowed down to only having classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays
so I intend to use this fact to work on my thesis on Mondays and
Wednesdays and get three day weekends as well. I've also got a pretty
nice class loadout to go with my beautiful schedule. I am taking 3.063:
Polymer Physics, 11.125: Exploring K-12 Classroom Teaching, and 21M.600:
Introduction to Acting. This term is going to be totally sweet.
