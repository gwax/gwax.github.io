Dude, George, do you remember the 50-lb. sacks of rice you had your
freshman year? That was awesome. Especially when we just left them on
Clam full of bugs at the end of the year.

Man... the days of excessive consumption of everything. I haven't had an
Amp in forever, nor have I eaten ramen from a champagne flute recently.

...or even played SSX.
