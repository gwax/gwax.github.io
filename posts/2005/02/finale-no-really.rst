Yesterday, the Liz and I went out for sushi at Kotobukiya and then went
to a desserterie in Harvard Square called Finale.

Liz and I both had the cheesecake; she got the recommended wine and I
had a flight of three ports.

Seeing as my poetic experience is very limited, I doubt that I can craft
words in a manner that will do justice to the quality to this dessert,
but I will nonetheless try. I began by eating some of the berries which
accompanied my cheesecake to build my anticipation and then I took a
small bite of the cheesecake. Upon consuming my first nibble of
cheesecake, my palatte was engulfed in such splendor as to fill my very
being. After the nibble of cheesecake, I took a small sip of each of my
three ports, which also left me a sense of wonder and awe. There was
some sort of chocolate adornment in the cheesecake and upon tasting it,
I had but one thought, "You must be kidding me." Each bite of my
cheesecake and sip of my ports was as good as the previous. The glory of
that dessert was such that I felt that my life had reached its apex.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that you absolutely must try the
desserts at this restaurant.
