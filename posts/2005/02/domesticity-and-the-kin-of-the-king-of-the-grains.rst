Having a kitchen lets me cook things and being able to cook things lets
me be all domestic and stuff. Yesterday, I baked a cake from scratch; it
was a bunch of fun and I've had cake to eat for the past day. Now I need
to figure out other fun stuff to cook and eat.

Speaking of cooking things, I have had a real hankering for wild rice of
late. In order to satiate myself, I obtained wild rice and am cooking
some right now. For those that don't know, wild rice is a distant
relative of traditional rice and is native to the Great Lakes region of
North America. Rice is, of course, the King of the Grains.

Wild rice is great and now I have some; also, cake.
