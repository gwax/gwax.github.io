I had an interview earlier today for a web development position and I'm
pretty sure that it went poorly, but as with all failures, there was
more learned than with success. To that end, having spent the first five
minutes of the car drive back beating myself up for screwing up and the
remaining twenty-five thinking about what I could have done better, I
have a pretty good idea of some of the mistakes I made.

My first reaction was to write all the things I would have liked to have
said here in the hopes that the interviewers might read my blog and
think better of me. Realizing that was both silly and a continuation of
the mistakes I was already making, that paragraph has been replaced with
this paragraph.

I figure my main problem was that I was too busy trying to figure out
what they wanted and how to impress my mad skillzors (sic) instead of
just trying to present me as me and hope that's what they want. I should
figure out a way to get better at meeting new people and being myself.
