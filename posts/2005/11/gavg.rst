Through one or another of the linksites I visit regularly, I came to an
article about a Kansas State U. support group for `girlfriends jealous
of video
games <http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1514150/20051118/index.jhtml?headlines=true>`__.
The group goes by Girlfriends Against Video Games and the article made
me think pretty much one thing, girls need to play more video games.
