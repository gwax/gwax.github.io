skillzors| These images are screenshots taken from my copy of Soul
Calibur that show my record of 1'04"02 in Arcade mode. All this thinking
about video games made me remember and I figured it was as good a time
as any to put proof on the intzorweb. We didn't think to tape it when I
beat the record, so this is the best I've got. Sorry about the tagging,
but I care about this and don't trust the internet half as far as I can
throw it. Also, since this was back when I was at my absolute best, I
would be mighty surprised if anyone has done any better than this, ever.
Some people on the internet seem to have claimed better times, but the
best confirmed time I've found is around 1'30; if you can find better,
please point me to it. It's a real pity that I didn't mange to beat a
minute. For the search engines, if they care, this is my best time high
score in Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast in Arcade Mode.
