I followed a link on `digg <http://digg.com/>`__ to an `article about
Mokume Gane <http://www.mokume-gane.com/Pages/What_is_Mokume.html>`__
and I've got to say, the feudal Japanese have done it again. Mokume Gane
is a method by which intricate designs can be made in the face of a
metal mixture and the site has some really impressive examples. I guess
this adds another technical level to my view of what the awesomest
wedding ring would be.
