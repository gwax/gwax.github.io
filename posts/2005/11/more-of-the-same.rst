   And out of nowhere, 3D ASCII art:

            ,---------,               ,---------
          ,/|       ,/|            ,-'|      ,-|
        ,/  |     ,/  |         ,-'   |   ,-'  |
        ----+----'    |         ------+--'     |
       |    |    |    |        |      |  |     |
       |    |    |    |        |      |  |     |
       |    |    |    |        |      |  |     |
       |    *----+----|        |      *--+-----|
       |  ,/     |  ,/         |   ,-'   |   ,-'
       |,/       |,/           |,-'      |,-'
        ---------'          ---------'

Yeah, I know it's not that great, but I was staring at a whole bunch of
text a bit ago and I started wondering if you could do half decent 3D
with ASCII art. Consider it an unpolished proof-of-concept. Oh and if
it's turning up as a pile of gobbledy-gook, you need to change your
browsers monospace font to be an actual monospace font.
