I appear to have the strange ability to cut myself with things you
wouldn't think you could get cut with but make sense after explanation.
My two examples of my executing this skill are when I cut myself on a
hamburger this summer and when I cut myself on a hammer yesterday. Ooh,
they both start with ham, I wonder if this means that I'm fated to cut
myself on a ham at some point in the future. Anyway, you might be asking
yourself how the Hell I might have managed to cut myself on a hamburger
and a hammer and you will find the answers forthright. The hamburger was
frozen at the time, and as frozen hamburgers go was in a large stack. I
was in the process of trying to separate a patty for myself and it came
free rather violently and sliced across my hand. As for yesterday, and
the hammer, I succeeded in stepping really hard on the claw-end of my
hammer and it cut right in making a great big gash on the bottom of my
foot. So take this as a lesson, beware hamburgers and hammers as more
than just blunt instruments, they've got some piercing power too.
