It's true that when we first met you were substantially better than I
was at SC, but I quickly adapted and we were eventually more-or-less
evenly matched, depending on who was playing which character.

Remember when I frustrated the fuck out of you by playing Ivy and
repeatedly kicking your ass with nothing but quick dodges and cuts?
