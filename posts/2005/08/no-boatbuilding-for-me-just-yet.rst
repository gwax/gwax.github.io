Team Vanguard decided to go the route of hiring a more experience
mechanical engineer so I won't be working for a boatbuilder in Rhode
Island any time soon. Truth be told, I've been starting to think that
it'd be a bit of a dead end way for me to go and I probably wouldn't
have wanted to stay for more than a couple of years. Although the
experience might have been fun and I might've learned a few things, I
expect there are better things for me to do. I expect this sounds a bit
like a sour grapes story but my only real annoyance at this point is
that I didn't even get an interview. Anyway, I guess this puts me back
at the drawing boards with regards to figuring out what I want to do
with myself, though that doesn't really matter until I leave the Cape
and my shoulder starts to work again.
