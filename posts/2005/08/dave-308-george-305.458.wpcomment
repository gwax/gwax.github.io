Don't know what dictionaries you have installed, my dict certainly
doesn't have that. Nor does the official Scrabble dictionary,
http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/pl/page.tools/dn/home.cfm, which by the
way says that "ok" and "oi" are also invalid. But I guess if neither of
you challenged those words, then the scrabble rules say anything goes...
