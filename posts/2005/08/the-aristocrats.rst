I saw The Aristocrats yesterday and it was even better than I expected.
Well, truth be told, I had mixed expectations but the movie turned out
to be really funny. It's certainly not for children or those who find
dirty (and I mean truly dirty) humor offensive. For those that haven't
heard of it, The Aristocrats is a documentary about a joke, one joke,
that has a long history of being told by comedians for comedians. You
might not think that a movie about a single joke would be funny all the
way through, but this one is and I highly recommend it.
