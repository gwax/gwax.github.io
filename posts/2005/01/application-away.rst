I turned in my application for grad school earlier today; yes, that's
singular. This year I am applying to only one grad school and if I don't
get in I am going to go do something else. That is my plan and I'm
sticking to it.

Anyway, the application is in and now I just need to worry about
graduating. The rest of my future is out already determined as far as I
am concerned.

I've chosen the track that I'm going to be on and now I just need to
toss coal into the furnace for a while.
