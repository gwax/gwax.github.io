Having settled into the bachelor's life pretty solidly at this point I
have recently discovered a wonderful new food which I have decided to
refer to as the Bachelor Burger. Here's how it works; you start with
cheap grocery store brand burger patties (all beef) and you fry them up
on a griddle, then you drop a nice slice of pepper jack cheese on top
(I'm using Cabot brand) and then drop it on a cheap grocery store brand
bun. I don't bother with condiments (not my style) but the cheap burger,
cheap bun and good strong cheese makes for a really tasty and
inexpensive combination. Such is the Bachelor Burger and it's mighty
good.
