I am an American, from my mongrel blood to my world views (I'm talking
ideal American, not the modern political majority). Being American puts
me in the unique position of being able to enjoy the benefits of the
so-called melting pot that is my country. The melting pot involves the
mixing and exchange of various bits of various cultures; one such bit is
fusion foods, foods that borrow from different cultures. Right now I am
eating fried kielbasa (Polish) and sipping good scotch whisky
(Scottish). The scotch and kielbasa combination isn't terribly
multicultural but it reminds me of my favorite food, kielbasa fried
rice. Kielbasa fried rice is a wonderful Polish/Asian fusion food. I was
too lazy too make kielbasa fried rice but that doesn't change my love of
fusion foods.
