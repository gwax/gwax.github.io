I'm deep in the land of Dixie (which being a proper noun can, sadly, not
be used in Scrabble) now, Savannah, Georgia to be precise, and it's time
for a break. What better way to take a break than to sit down and update
my blog? Probably a bunch of things but that's not the point.

I've been getting pretty tired of the alphabet game so I've only
finished 3 more alphabets putting me at 25 and looking for a "Q". I've
also been tearing a pretty solid swathe through my CD collection having
fully listened to 14 KMFDM albums, 1 KMFDM single, 1 MDFMK album, 1
KMFDM vs. Pig album, 1 Lucia album, 1 Happy 2B Hardcore compilation, 1
Aphex Twin album, 1 Daft Punk album, 1 Gigi D'Agostino compilation and 1
Mr. Velcro Fastener album. I think that I'm going to give local radio a
shot for a while.

I don't really mind the driving; it's kind of pleasant. I am getting a
little bit fatigued but not tired or tired of the driving, a problem
solvable by breaks like this. The sun is setting; that should make
things different. Let's see if I can get another 4 hours of driving in
and make my way into Florida.
