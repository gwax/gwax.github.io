Max and I have been meaning to go skiing this IAP and we finally got
around to it today. So, this morning at about 7a, Max, Bryan, Gus and I
set out for points north. By 10:30a, we had rented skis and were getting
on the ski lift at Waterville Valley in New Hampshire. It's worth noting
the costs associated with getting to this point: $34 for a lift ticket
(with college ID) and $32 for equipment rental; totally $66. We then
proceeded to ski, with a brief lunch break, clear through about 4p. The
drive is not that bad, the price is pretty good and, overall, it's
totally worth it for 5 hours of decent skiing with my friends.
