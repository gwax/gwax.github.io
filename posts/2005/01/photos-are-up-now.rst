Since my sidekick can operate as a digital camera, it only makes sense
that I take pictures of things every so often. Now, taking pictures is
one thing, sharing them with other people is a slightly different thing
and as such I have set up a photo gallery/photoblog/whatever called
`gwax's sitings <http://photos.gwax.com/>`__ (now I can rumble and
site). There aren't any comments or names for the existing photos (I
might add some later) but from now on I'll be adding them.

Enjoy

**Update:** I have culled a lot of the photos to eliminate redundancy
and low quality pictures. Also, I have added descriptions for all of the
old photos. Some of the earlier photos are in a funny order because the
time stamps were a little messed up.
