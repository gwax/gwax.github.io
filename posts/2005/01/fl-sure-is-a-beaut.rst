I'm not lost but I'm somewhere in Southern Florida and I don't know
exactly where I am. It doesn't much matter as my time is valueless right
now and I am pretty good at figuring out where I am in strange places.

Truth be told, I am actually kind of glad that I am bushwhacking through
unknown territories. This is a beautiful part of the world that I had
never seen before. It reminds me of Southern California a whole lot.

I've found I-95 now, so all my problems are solved from here to
Massachusetts.
