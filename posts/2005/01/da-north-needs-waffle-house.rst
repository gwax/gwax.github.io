I've come in contact with a new chain restaurant on my trip into the
South, Waffle House. Waffle House is pretty much what you'd expect given
the name and is pretty tasty. It's a little better than IHOP or
Bickford's in my opinion.

Also, they have grits, which are a new thing for me too. Grits are good.
