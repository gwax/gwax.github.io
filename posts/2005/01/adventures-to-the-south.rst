Tomorrow I begin my grand adventures off to the South. I will be driving
to Virginia tomorrow morning to visit my very good friend Sherv, whom I
have not seen in quite a long time. I will spend a few days hanging out
with Sherv and then I will probably proceed onward to Florida, where I
will hang out with Gus in Key West. I'll be getting back sometime around
the middle of the week of the 10th.

I'll be dragging my sidekick with me, so you may get some posts during
the trip and if any of you are going to be geographically between
Massachusetts and Florida during my trip, give me a call or email and
I'll stop by to say hi.
