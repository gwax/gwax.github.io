Having become annoyed with comment-spam, I have chosen to implement
`Gudlyf's AuthImage <http://www.gudlyf.com/index.php?p=376>`__ plugin
for WordPress. The plugin makes one of those pictures with funny text
that's hard for computers to parse. The plugin also demands that you
type in the contents of the image or you don't get to post a comment. I
don't really like forcing something like this on people but the spam was
pissing me off and this seems less obtrusive than sending peoples'
comments to moderation and then accepting them later. If this is really
unpleasant for people, let me know and I'll consider other options.
