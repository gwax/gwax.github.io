I remembered hearing, long ago, that peanut butter doesn't tend to go
bad but that when it does, it becomes very carcinogenic. Not knowing the
details of this little fact, I turned to the internet and found a bunch
of sources to explain what was going on.

The molds Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus grow on a
number of things and grow especially well on peanuts. These molds
release a chemical known as aflatoxin, which is a strong carcinogen and
has been linked to liver cancer.

The FDA monitors aflatoxin levels in commercial products and it turns
out to be the case that the big brand peanut butters (Skippy, Jif, etc.)
have the lowest levels of aflatoxin. Also, if you go to a health food
store and get freshly ground peanut butter, you're dumping tons of
aflatoxin into yourself.

So buy big brand peanut butter and don't let it go bad.
