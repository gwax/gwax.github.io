It looks as though Microsoft has decided to capitalize on their
ownership of FASA Interactive and the rights to all FASA based video
games. Production is underway on a Shadowrun game for the Xbox 360
(related articles

and `here <http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/635/635071p1.html>`__ and
elsewhere). It looks like Microsoft may have found a way to convince me
to buy an Xbox 360 or, at the very least, get under my skin about it.
God I hope this game doesn't suck.
