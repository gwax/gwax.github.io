I've finally gotten around to doing a full workup of my Wordpress theme
so as to provide a style more in line with the style that I use on `my
homepage <http://www.gwax.com/>`__ and also to bring my blog up to XHTML
1.1 compliance. Being only one man, I haven't been able to do a complete
QA workup of the theme so if you see anything that looks wrong, doesn't
work on your browser (I've tested Firefox 1.0.6 and IE 6.0 under Windows
XP some) or doesn't validate to XHTML 1.1, please let me know so that I
can fix it. Beyond that, I'll try to find any problems that I can.

Also, I've decided to stop using nested comments and to get rid of the
comment preview box because I was the only person using the nested
comments and the live preview box didn't work well enough for my tastes.
