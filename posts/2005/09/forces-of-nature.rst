I have a number of thoughts about this whole Katrina wrecking New
Orleans thing:

-  I'd like to extend my utmost sympathy to those directly affected by
   this disaster.
-  theodicy
   n : the branch of theology that defends God's goodness and justice in
   the face of the existence of evil
-  Where the Hell, is the National Guard? Isn't it their job to help out
   in situations like this? Oh, that's right, they're in Iraq trying to
   get us cheap oil. Guess what doesn't matter when our refineries at
   home get wrecked: cheap crude oil. Or was it trying to protect our
   people from danger, because Katrina is killing more Americans than
   the Iraqis are.
-  Our President is `not taking this seriously
   enough <http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/31/_a_tale_of_two_photo.html>`__
-  I wonder how long it will be until New Orleans exists again.
-  `Hippo's blog <http://fluxion.mit.edu/blog/index.cgi/katrina.html>`__
   has an interesting idea about repairing communication infrastructure
   quickly in disasters like this.
-  I hope the death toll is lower than expected.
