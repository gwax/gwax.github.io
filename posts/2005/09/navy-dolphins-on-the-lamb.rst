It turns out the US Navy has been training dolphins to help protect
ships and kill terrorists. That the military has been doing this is news
to me and I think it's incredibly keen, albeit ethically questionable.
On top of the keenness of trained dolphins, apparently some of the
dolphins have been outfitted with toxic dart guns; how metal is that?
Now, you might be asking where the lambs come into this whole thing, and
to get into that we need to ask where the Navy's been doing this
research? Turns out the research was being done in good old Southern
Louisiana. What with all that Hurricane Katrina stuff going on down
there, there's some concern that some of the `armed dolphins might have
escaped <http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1577753,00.html>`__
and might accidentally shoot unsuspecting divers and surfers. Escaped
military dolphins with toxic dart guns; this is almost as good as
"sharks with friggin' laser beams on their heads".
