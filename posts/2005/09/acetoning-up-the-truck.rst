Earlier today, I read on the internet that you can use acetone as a fuel
additive and get better gas mileage from your car. Now, since everything
on the internet is true or, at least, I don't really care if I
accidentally break my truck in the name of science, I dumped about 3oz.
of acetone into my mostly full tank of gas. I'll let you know how things
turn out after a tank or three for statistics. According to
http://smartgas.net, who seem to have looked into it a bunch, adding
1-3oz. Of acetone to 10 gallons of gas will give you up to 30% better
mileage. I'll keep you posted.
