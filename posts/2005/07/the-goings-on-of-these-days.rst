I've been on the Cape almost a week at this point, began working
yesterday and things have been mostly good. Unfortunately, the weather
has been rather poor so I haven't been able to go sailing since last
weekend and it won't get nice again until about Sunday. With luck, us
folks here won't let a little bad weather get in the way of our Friday
night BBQ plans. Anyway, just wanted to say hi and let you all know that
I'm still alive. George out.

Incidentally, if any of you all want to come visit me on the Cape,
chillax and maybe do a little sailing, drop me a line (phone, email, IM,
whatever).
