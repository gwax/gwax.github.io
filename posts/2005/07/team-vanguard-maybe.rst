I spoke on the phone with a man from the boatbuilding company `Team
Vanguard <http://www.teamvanguard.com/>`__, which is based in Rhode
Island. I've had some correspondance with a couple of guys in the
company over the past few weeks with regards to the possibility of
trying to get an engineering job with them. They're going to be doing
interviews in a few weeks and with luck, I'll get to be one of them. If
all goes well, I'll be a boatbuilding engineer next year; I'll keep you
all posted as things progress.
