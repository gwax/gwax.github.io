I have set up the `StatTraq <http://randypeterman.com/StatTraq/>`__
plugin for wordpress to handle gathering `statistical information on my
blog <http://blog.gwax.com/wp-stattraq/>`__ and have made it publicly
viewable for anyone that cares. There is also a small "Statistics" link
in the Meta section of my sidebar now. In order to get it working, I
started with StatTraq 1.0b and hand applied the `patches from
adsworth <http://www.adsworth.info/category/software/stattraq/>`__. So
yeah, statistics are up and you should feel free to `take a
look <http://blog.gwax.com/wp-stattraq/>`__ at them.

Obviously, the statistics are incomplete as they only begin tracking as
of a day ago.
