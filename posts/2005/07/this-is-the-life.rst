Last night, a bunch of the gang and I went ice block sledding, which is
truly one of the most fun things one can do. After that, Dave, Julia and
I went back to Dave's place and sat around playing Scrabble for a while.
If you add to that, playing go, sailing, partying and sitting around,
you've got a pretty solid picture of what I do these days. It's really
quite pleasant all around. Of course, I do work on weekdays, but that's
kind of nice too.
