Before ice block sledding last night, Dave and I encountered a bunch of
younger folks on the golf course and we were informed that we, "Diesel
Dave" and "The Beard Guy", are legends. I have got to say, it's pretty
keen to be a legend, even if it's for a bunch of teenagers.

**Side note:** If you're looking for information on the book I am Legend
by Richard Matheson, you should look somewhere else. That having been
said, I did intend the reference and highly recommend the book
