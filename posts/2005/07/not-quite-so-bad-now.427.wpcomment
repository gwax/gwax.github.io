It's about what was described in the previous three posts: my moonroof
exploding, being forced to beach my boat for a day and then accidentally
screwing up bits of my blog. All small insignificant things, but so many
happened at once that I got really pissed off for a day or so.
Thankfully, it all passed without incident.
