Good lord! Your receipt reflects everything I have eaten today! Since I
was at work at 9 am, I had a Coke for breakfast. Then, on my drive home,
we stopped at McDonalds and I got two cheeseburgers and a medium fries,
which is the only thing I ever get there. Clearly, the "Super Secret"
part of your Super Secret Value Meal is the fact that it has the ability
to read minds...
