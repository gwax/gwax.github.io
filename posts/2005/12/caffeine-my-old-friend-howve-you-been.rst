I decided to bring my tea pot and some of my tea to work today and the
result was, of course, that I drank a bunch of tea today (three pots).
The first two pots I brewed were of Russian Caravan, which is a very
good, dark, high caffeine tea. Now, I've been living an almost
caffeine-free life for the past few months and so my system reacted
rather strongly to two pots of strong tea, leaving me rather on the
wired side by noon; my reaction was a little stronger than I would like,
but it's not unpleasant and in the past it's been fantastic in improving
my performance in a given day. I guess, in short, I've rediscovered
caffeine and oh man, is it great.
