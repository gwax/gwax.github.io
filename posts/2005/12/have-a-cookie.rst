I just fixed some problems with the code at work, mentioned so doing to
someone I was intermittently chatting with on AIM and received a
response along the lines of, "give yourself a cookie". I was about to
respond that I don't have any cookies when someone walked into my
cubicle and offered me a cookie; that folks, is synchronicity.
