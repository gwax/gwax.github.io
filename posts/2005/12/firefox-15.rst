So I went ahead and upgraded my web browser to `Firefox
1.5 <http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/>`__ and my impressions so far are
positive, only slightly so, but still positive.To tell the truth, I
haven't really noticed much of a difference at all, except in so far as
Mozilla Firesomething (which I mentioned `a while
back <http://blog.gwax.com/2004/05/24/mozilla-taconarwhal/>`__) doesn't
work. I really like Firesomething, but I can live without it until they
upgrade it to be v1.5 compatible. The big changes as far as I'm
concerned are that Firefox 1.5 now has support for CSS2, CSS3 and SVG; I
expect I will update my blog and web site .css files to take advantage
of some of the new features sometime soon. Other than that, there are
supposedly bug fixes and speed improvements but whatever.

If you're still using Internet Explorer, I really do recommend switching
to `Firefox <http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/>`__, it's vastly superior.
