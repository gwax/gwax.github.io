Hippo, are you still in Internet preschool? If this is the most
convoluted prose you've read online, then you obviously haven't been
looking around too much. You're probably the kind of guy who, if you
sold your computer to Crazy Bartholomew's Discount Digitalia, would be
referred to as the nerd equivalent of the little old lady who only drove
her car to the grocery store and to church on Sunday. Jesus Christ.
