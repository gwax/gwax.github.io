...and McDonald's is the witch trying to fatten me up so she can eat me.
I mean, come on, $1 for one apple pie and $1 dollar for two apple pies;
I didn't want two but I'll be damned if I'm going to pass on a free
apple pie. I probably would have been fine with paying 75Â¢ for one;
McDonald's, unless your plan is to make less money, your economics are
wrong.
