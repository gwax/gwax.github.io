Turns out, I'm employable and, not only that, I've become employed. This
now marks the end of my sitting around all day on my computer editing
`Uncyclopedia <http://uncyclopedia.org/>`__, watching
`YTMND <http://ytmnd.com>`__\ s and generally reading the intzorweb. Oh
well, the times were good while they lasted and now I'll get to have
money again. Anyway, I've been hired by `Innov-X
Systems <http://www.innov-xsys.com/>`__; they make portable
`XRF <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_fluorescence>`__ devices for
various applications. My official title is "R&D Scientist", which I
think is a pretty keen title. My job is going to be a mix of materials
science stuff and computer work, so it should be fun and interesting. So
yeah, no longer unemployed.
