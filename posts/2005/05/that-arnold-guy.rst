Yesterday I went to Arnold's Arboretum with a bunch of friends. The
place is absolutely beautiful and it has some terribly exquisite flora.
Another point worth noting is the sheer size of the arboretum; it's
enormous (~2mi x ~.5mi). The arboretum houses the Larz Anderson Bonsai
Collection, which is probably the single most moving thing that I have
ever seen. I highly recommend a visit to the arboretum for anyone.
