Everything that I do is one fewer thing that I ever have to do. The
problem set that I just finished for 3.063 is the last problem set that
I'm ever going to have to do at MIT. The two papers that I intend to
write this weekend will be the last papers that I'm ever going to have
to write at MIT. When I turn in my thesis a week from Friday, it's going
to be the last thing that I ever have to turn in at MIT. Graduation will
then be the last thing that I ever have to do at MIT. In a way it's all
very thrilling and liberating but in another way it's a little
depressing.
