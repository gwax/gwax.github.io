A while back I put Norton Internet Security 2005 on my computer because
I thought that it might be good to protect myself from some of the
various dangers of the internet. It turns out that it was a stupid
decision because Norton Internet Security has caused me more grief than
anything else. The program, essentially, mangles and breaks your
internet connection. Web pages will stop working, e-mail programs will
stop working, things will break. What you're supposed to do to overcome
these problems is tweak some of the settings to allow certain things
through but there isn't good documentation on how to do that and half
the time it doesn't work. So, I'm fed up with that piece of crap and it
can go fuck itself.
