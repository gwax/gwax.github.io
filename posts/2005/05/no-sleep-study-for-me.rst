For the past week, I've been courting a sleep research study as a means
of entertaining myself and making some easy money. The plan was to take
part in a 32 day in patient study shortly after graduation and walk away
with a cool $6k. Unfortunately, it turns out my current sleep schedule
is too erratic to make me an acceptable participant in their study. All
I have to say about that is, shucks.
