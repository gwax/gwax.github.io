With their powers combined, Debian and R-type form my new server setup.
Since I was getting pretty sick of using VNC to connect to r-type when I
needed to change or fix something, I decided to get Linux up and running
on it instead of Windows 2k. Having gone through the process, r-type is
now running Debian, which gives me the wonderful powers of SSH and
apt-get. SSH is the part that I really care about because I can now futz
with things from my sidekick, any Linux machine and any Windows machine
that I can put PuTTY on.

As a side advantage, I've managed to get SSL working so now I can deal
with administering my blog and phpmyadmin over a secure connection.
