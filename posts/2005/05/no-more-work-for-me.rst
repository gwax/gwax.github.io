I have just finished the last of the work that I need to do at MIT. In a
few hours, I will go to campus print out a few things, hand in a few
things, go to a few classes and then be all done.

Also, I decided that I might as well pull an all-nighter because it
would be my last chance to justifiably do so at MIT.
