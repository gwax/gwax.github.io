Aww, that's a little bit of un-fun. Well, all the more reason for you to
come live with me in Ithaca this summer (re: my latest LJ post). And
yes, of course that follows logically. Either way, May 6th is just
around the corner, and as we all know, there is no better day on which
to meet single chicks than on `No Pants
Day <http://www.nopantsday.com/index.php?participate=1>`__.
