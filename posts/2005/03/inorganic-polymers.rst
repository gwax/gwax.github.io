I've been looking into inorganic polymers a little and intend to write
about them for my Polymer Physics final paper. They turn out to be
rather interesting and have all sort of interesting backbones like
silicon, germanium, tin (a metal), phosphorous-nitrogen, and others.

The Si and Sn backboned polymers are the most interesting to me, having
interesting conductive and physical properties. As an example,
polydimethylsilane (silicon backone with two methyl groups off each
silicon) is a crystalline polymer that is insoluble in everything and
does not melt (but does decompose at 250Â°C). All in all, very curious
materials that I will be looking into.
