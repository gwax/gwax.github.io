I went to McDonald's with Max earlier today and we made a very
interesting observation: Value Meals are not the most cost efficient way
to get food. Purchasing a double cheeseburger with large fries and large
drink was $0.89 cheaper than purchasing a regular Big and Tasty meal
(the cheapest of the value meals). I could have purchased a second
double cheeseburger and still had it be much cheaper than any large
value meal. I am also reminded of my recent meal at the Ashland, NH
Burger King where Sam got three Rodeo Burgers, fries and a drink for
less than my double bacon cheeseburger meal.

Henceforth, I shall no longer assume that a value meal is the cheapest
way for me to get what I want. It's kind of sad because I can remember
when value meals actually were a good value.
