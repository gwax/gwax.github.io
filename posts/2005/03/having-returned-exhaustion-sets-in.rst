Our camping trip ended up being two days long instead of three and while
parts of me are disappointed, other parts are sore and glad to have
woken up in a real bed. All in all, it doesn't really matter too much to
me whether we went for one night or two, it just matters that we went; I
was glad to have some time roughing it and hanging out with some good
friends.

The trip went pretty much like this: We left Sunday morning at around
8:30a from MIT's Random Hall. Taking I-93N to Ashland where we got onto
US-3, which took us to NH-113, which in turn led to NH-113A, which led
to Whiteface Intervale Road, off of which we found trailhead parking.
Incidentally, the frost heaves on NH-113A are atrocious (go too fast and
you will likely kill your car). From trailhead, we took Flat Mountain
Pond Trail up and into the Sandwich Range Wilderness. Hiking in was
moderate at first with a packed trail but as the trail split, with one
fork heading to Mount Whiteface and the other heading to Flat Mountain
Pond, we were left with untouched snow. Snowshoeing on the unpacked snow
is not bad at all but the trail started to gain in inclination and was
moderately steep for a long while. At the end of day one, we were
exhausted and camped a few hundred feet from the trail, near the
northeastern shore of Flat Mountain Pond. After a night that got colder
each of the three times I woke up, I found myself to be the first one
awake after sunrise. Being the first one awake, I decided to go about
making a fire, which was fun and I managed with one match. Smalltime was
the second person awake and he helped me gather some firewood.
Eventually, everyone woke up, we gathered our stuff and set out. We were
planning to continue along the Flat Mountain Pond Trail until what point
as we felt like stopping, camp and finish the next day but we ended up
making it all the way back down on the second day. Making it down, we
hopped in our vehicles and headed back, stopping at the Burger King in
Ashland, NH as is traditional for these trips (and anytime I do any
hiking in northern New Hampshire). Such was how the third annual spring
break camping trip went.

Now for the rest of spring break, I will spend a few days at home and
then some time working on my thesis.
