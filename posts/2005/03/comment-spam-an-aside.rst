Comment spam pisses me off. It's not terribly hard to get rid of in
WordPress but I don't like having to. What's worse is that this is why I
installed one of those fancy image authentication things.

Let's take a moment to think about spam. Most people don't like spam and
it doesn't work on most people. Spam is a very cheap form of advertising
but not free. In order for spam to continue to exist, there have to be
at least a small number of people that respond to spam and to those
people I say, *STOP BEING A FUCKING RETARD, YOU DON'T NEED WHAT THEY'RE
SELLING AND YOU ARE RUINING THINGS FOR THE REST OF US!*
