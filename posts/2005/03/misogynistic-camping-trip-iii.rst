This spring break will mark the Third Annual Misogynistic Camping Trip.
Sam, Max, Hippo, Ian and I are going up to New Hampshire to be cold and
"be men". We will leave late Saturday, spend the night at Sam's
grandparents' place in North Conway and begin our hike early Sunday
morning. We will be in the mountains through late Tuesday and should be
back in Massachusetts before Wednesday.

The rest of y'all can plan your lives (or vacations) around that (or
not).
