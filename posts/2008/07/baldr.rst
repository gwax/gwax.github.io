Yesterday, I went and picked up my new puppy. My puppy is a purebred
Saint Bernard with strong champion ancestry from `Conifer Creek
Farm <http://www.conifercreek.com/>`__ in Rough and Ready, CA.

After a great deal of consideration, I have decided to name my puppy
`Baldr <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldr>`__, after the Norse God
commonly associated with light and goodness. I had previously been
considering Heimdallr and Odin but Heimdallr sounded too cumbersome and
the breeder, a very friendly man by the name of David McKague, related
to me the story of a Saint Bernard named Odin who had been nothing but
trouble. As much as I like to be contrarian and see Baldr as a bit like
the Jesus of the Norse, it really is a good name. Baldr was often called
Baldr the Good for a reason and I think that it's a very respectable and
good sounding name for a dog.

I will post pictures as soon as soon as I get an xD card for the camera
a friend gave me or am able to get someone else to take some pictures
for me.
