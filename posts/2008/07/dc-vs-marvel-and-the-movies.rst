For rather a long time, I've been a stalwart Marvel comics fan but upon
seeing the `Watchmen movie
trailer <http://io9.com/5026402/watch-how-faithful-watchmen-will-be>`__,
I find myself re-evaluating my stance a little. I've always liked the
X-Men; Thanos, Galactus and Magneto are awesome villains; Superman is
super lame; and there are so many other reasons to love Marvel, like all
the cartoons. However, all that neglects some of the great things D.C.
has been involved in, for instance, pretty much everything Batman except
the movies between Batman Returns and Batman Begins. The Batman books
are gold, the Batman cartoons have all been gold, Jack Nicholson's Joker
was gold, Batman Begins was gold and I am so psyched about The Dark
Knight that it's not even funny. On top of that, there's a bunch of
other things D.C. has done right, including
`Watchmen <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen>`__ and
`Transmetropolitan <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmetropolitan>`__,
probably the two greatest graphic novels of all time.

Marvel, however has been putting out movies best classified as bad
followed by worse, with the notable exception of Iron Man, which was
pretty ok. Why then does Marvel deserve my praise? Their comics are
still pretty decent but they certainly aren't Dark Horse, though really,
nobody else is. Are the X-Men really that great or is it that they were
really cool when I was a kid and I haven't come to realize how simple
they really are?

You know, I think I'm switching my allegiances. As of now, I officially
like D.C. more than Marvel, though I still prefer Image, Dark Horse and
a few indie publishers more. Seriously though, The Dark Knight looks
awesome as all get up and so does Watchmen.

Ok, I'm going to watch the Watchmen trailer one more time and then I'll
be done geeking out.
