As a lawyer I am obligated to ask whether you have any back, neck, or
other pains. Glad that you survived to blog about it. It's a good story.
If you're back in MN next winter I have a new event for you: Bock Fest
at the Schell's brewery. I think I demolished your standing records for
beads, by the way.
