Glad to hear that you're OK. Your story reminds me of the famous
"Mexican breakfast" wreck that I was in on I-95 in Connecticut (cousin
was driving us back from New York). No injuries either, and my cousin
had the wisdom to take out insurance on the rental car that we used, but
it was still pretty jarring for a few months afterward...
