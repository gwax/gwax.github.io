It's the 4\ :sup:`th` of January in a new year and, if you've followed
me this far, you `might recall </2007/01/04/the-magical-anniversary/>`__
that this is the
`anniversary </2006/01/04/second-needless-banter-anniversary/>`__ of
gwax's rumblings' `fp </2004/01/04/fp/>`__ (first post). Although it's
been a slow year and I've gotten pretty lazy about updating regularly,
I've been doing this for four years and I'm not planning to stop just
yet. Speaking of anniversaries, you might `recall the
sychronicity </2006/01/04/more-birfdays/>`__ of my blog sharing a
birthday with `Uncyclopedia <http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Main_Page>`__,
which just turned three.
