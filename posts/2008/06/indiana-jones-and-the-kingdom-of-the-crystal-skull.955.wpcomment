Really? Cuz I thought it was rather suck. Perhaps I just haven't been
exposed to enough crappier George Lucas crap.

By the way, did you notice the pervasive and relentless use of
backlighting IN EVERY SCENE, even when it was pitch dark? I'm not sure
why they thought Indy needed an annoying, white glow, but man, I could
barely follow along with the inconceivable plot, I was so busy looking
at his highlights.
