Saturday evening, I went out with some friends and saw `The
Fall <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_%282006_film%29>`__, which
was, I must say, a gorgeous movie. The movie is quite artistic, pretty
and rather fun. It gets a wee bit on the odd side at a number of points
and there are a few WTF?! moments but, overall, the film is quite
coherent and a very nice way to spend a couple hours. Unfortunately, The
Fall, being thoroughly independent, is suffering very poor distribution
and showing up in a rather small number of theaters but, in my opinion,
it's worth seeking out one of those theaters and seeing it.
