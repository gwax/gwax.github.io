`Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal
Skull <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull>`__
is not that bad. With the crap that George Lucas has been putting out
recently, I'm surprised the new Indiana Jones movie was not worse. The
increased use of special effects and CG definitely hurt the movie but
not as much as `that Gungan
idiot <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks>`__ hurt Star Wars.
Ultimately, the goal and ending of the movie were pretty poor but the
early and middle parts of the movie were plenty decent as far as Indiana
Jones' style is concerned.

Funny that aliens and flying saucers are less reasonable than the hand
of God but I think that's just the way my mind says the world of Indiana
Jones is supposed to be.
