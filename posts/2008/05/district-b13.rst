In today's edition of George brings you obscure movies that you should
have heard of, District B13. This 2004, French film, produced by the
great Luc Besson, stars David Belle, founder of
`Parkour <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour>`__ and involves
acrobatics and ass-kicking that easily match the better things coming
out of Asia recently. Take one part post-apocalyptic action film, add a
dash of drug lords, some neutron bombs, two parts crazy martial arts, a
liberal sprinkling of really good French traceurs, bake for an hour and
a half and you get, well, a pretty phenomenally awesome movie. No wires
or special effects necessary.
