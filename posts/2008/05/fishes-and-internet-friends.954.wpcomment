I know that it was school year 2002-2003 and I thought it was fall but I
guess that my memory is, as always, poor.

Nonetheless, I was "one of the first", which I `can't
prove <http://blog.gwax.com/2004/04/13/ozone-beast-is-dying/>`__ and
don't really care about proving; there are better reasons why I have a
huge Internet penis.
