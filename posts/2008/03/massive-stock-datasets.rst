When data-mining, the first step is to obtain the data that you would
like to mine. I have decided that I would like to try my hand at playing
the stock market so it became necessary for me to obtain historical
stock market data. To that end, I have devised a method to obtain end of
day results for every listing on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ since their
inception. The data is in the process of being assembled and I expect it
to be complete within a few days. Current estimates expect the data to
take up approximately 2GB, making it the largest single dataset that I
have ever played with. Just having this much data makes my data hoarding
senses tingle.

I'll probably spend a little bit of time putting the data into an easy
to understand and use format and then I'll start looking for patterns.
I'm hoping to throw my modeling background and experience at the stock
market to see if I can't beat the system. If I can beat the stock market
and make bajillions of dollars (or euro if the dollar collapses) that
would be pretty sweet but if I don't, at the very least, I expect to
have fun playing with lots and lots of numbers.

As a second approach, since it turns out to be rather difficult to get
this sort of data in the first place, I'm half considering the idea of
cleaning it up a bit and then reselling it myself.
