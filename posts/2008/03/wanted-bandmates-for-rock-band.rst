Yesterday, I wandered over to Best Buy and finally picked up a copy of
Rock Band for my Xbox 360. As I have `already
establish <link://slug/rock-band>`__, Rock Band is
awesome, so I'm mighty psyched to have a copy at the place now. I wasn't
properly set up for it earlier but now that we've got a projector and a
proper sound system, we have an amazing Rock Band setup. Rock Band, of
course, is far better as a multiplayer experience than a one person
game, so anytime that any of you folks want to stop by and jam with me,
you're more than welcome to do so.
