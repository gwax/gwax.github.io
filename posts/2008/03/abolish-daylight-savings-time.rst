In all seriousness, I don't know why we need daylight savings time. All
it does is make me have to change my clocks twice a year and likely miss
at least one scheduled event shortly after the transition. Sleep
schedules `don't have much to do with
daylight <http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-03/uocp-etb030608.php>`__
so why are we trying to force to two to coincide. We really need to get
rid of these pathetic vestiges of days past and make our time get with
the time. I hereby, publicly request that Daylight Savings Time tender
its resignation, effective immediately.
