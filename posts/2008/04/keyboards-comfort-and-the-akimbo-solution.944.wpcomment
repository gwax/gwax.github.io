I don't want it for ergonomic reasons; those would be solved by getting
two. I want it for the switch based keys and the careful weighting
targeted at different fingers. On top of that, having all the keys be
unlabeled would break my habit of looking down at the keyboard
occasionally. The cupped home keys also sound like a keen idea.
