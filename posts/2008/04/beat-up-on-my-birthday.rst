Today marks yet one more year of my survival on this planet; go me! This
year, I'm starting the George New Year right: thoroughly beat up. Last
night I caught a Ministry and Meshuggah show, which was amazing, and
availed myself of the mosh pit. As with other metal/industrial mosh pits
that I've encountered, things were very civilized and the intent was
definitely one of energy and excitement, not one of violence. It was a
good mosh pit, but it was a pretty brutal one too; I am certainly rather
thoroughly tenderized and I will be aching for at least a few days. It's
been quite some time since I've gotten a chance to be in a proper mosh
pit and I'm quite pleased to have gotten the chance again. Now, time to
take it a bit easier and let my body recover, also, find some cake,
birthday cake that is.
