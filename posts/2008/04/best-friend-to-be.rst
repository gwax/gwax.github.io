I have been inspired by `Weebles' recent friend
making <http://blog.jfet.org/2008/03>`__ to stop talking about getting a
dog and actually be proactive in getting a dog. To that end, I have been
in contact with a somewhat local breeder of Saint Bernards. I have
chosen the Saint Bernard as a breed for a number of reasons, basically
boiling down to size and temperament. I want a large dog that can serve
as a pack dog for all season hiking/camping trips and can pull me around
the city on my skateboard. Additionally, I want a dog that will be chill
and maintain his cool in situations ranging from alone in the afternoon
to a party with hundreds of people. There are plenty of other reasons
but that's an overview.

Having, as I mentioned, been in contact with a breeder, I have arranged
to obtain one of the pups from the next breeding cycles, which will put
a Saint Bernard puppy moving in with me sometime during the first week
of August. At some point in the not too distant future, I'll have to
start preparing for the puppy but for now I need to come up with a name.

My current front-running name is
`Heimdallr <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdall>`__ (after the Norse
God) but it's early enough in the process that I'm willing to accept
alternative suggestions. Leave suggestions in the comments.
