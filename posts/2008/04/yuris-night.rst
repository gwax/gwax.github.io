Last night, I attended the `Bay Area Yuri's
Night <http://yurisnightbayarea.net/>`__ celebration, which was a big
celebration of `Yuri
Gagarin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin>`__. Yuri Gagarin was
the first man in space and the celebration was at NASA Ames, with a
couple great big hangers full of art, science and/or engineering
exhibitions, constant musical performances and some other wonderful
stuff. It was an amazing celebration, my favorite parts included, but
were certainly not limited to, the `Amon
Tobin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon_Tobin>`__ set, the aerobatic
show, Spore and, quite frankly, my roommate Gene's dynamic fractal
exhibition piece. It was an amazing event, made better by how many
people I knew that were present but it was, at the same time, a sad
reminder of how under-appreciated NASA is by our country, our government
and our people.
