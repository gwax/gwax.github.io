You need to make this a product that I can buy. Mouse in the middle is
one of the few configurations that I can sustain, which I jury rig by
crossing my arm over my kinesis to the other side's mouse - at work on
my left, and at home on my right.

Also, get your damn company to buy you a Kinesis. They're taking the
best years of your life - they might as well leave you with functional
use afterwards.
