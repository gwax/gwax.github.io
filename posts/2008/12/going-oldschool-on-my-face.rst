Recently, a `particular xkcd comic <http://xkcd.com/491/>`__ got me
thinking about shaving equipment. I, shortly thereafter, purchased a
Burma Shave soap/mug/brush set from
`amazon <http://www.amazon.com/Burma-Shave-Mug-Brush-Soap-Piece/dp/B001B2S350/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1229711517&sr=8-1>`__
at a very reasonable price. Very quickly, I came to realize that the
soap and brush approach is vastly superior to the shaving cream or gel
approach. The soap and brush lather gives me a closer shave with less
razor burn; so much so, in fact, that I am now able to go over my face
twice every morning without razor burn.

My Burma-Shave soap puck was running out last week, so I turned to the
wonderful `ClassicShaving.com <http://www.classicshaving.com/>`__,
purveyors of old fashioned shaving supplies, to get more soap. Choosing
to go with Jasmine and Lavender, I ordered two pucks of soap and then
moved on to looking at the available razors. Though I think it would be
awesome to use a straight razor, the cost of straight razors and the
necessary implements to keep them sharp are simply too much for me to
justify right now, so I focused on the double edge safety razors.
Choosing a rather nice double edged razor and a pack of high quality
blades, I completed my order.

Shaving for the first time, this morning, with my new soap and new
razor, I find two things: 1) a brush and soap puck is absolutely the
correct way to lather for shaving, and 2) I need a lot more patience and
practice with using a traditional razor. It's pretty awesome to shave
with a double edged razor and where I did it right, I got a great shave
but there are a lot of places on my face today that got nicked or poorly
shaved this morning.

Another detail worth noting is that really good blades for a
double-edged razor cost about 60Â¢ a piece and are good for about 7 days,
which is much better than the ~$5 a piece for modern multi-blade razor
cartridges.
