Dear Intarwebs,

I feel that it behooves me to bring the existence of the `Infinity
Maze <http://www.infinitymaze.com/>`__ to your attention. Infinity Maze
is the webcomic of my brother, Dave. As might not be surprising for the
work of one of my kin, the comic is rather bizarre. The art is somewhat
crude but the writing is usually pretty top notch, in my opinion. I may
be biased by the humor matching my sense thereof but, that said, I do
highly recommend the comic to you, my good Intarwebs.
