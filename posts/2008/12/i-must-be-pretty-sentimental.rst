Just a bit ago, I was performing a quick search of my blog for
`monkeys <http://blog.gwax.com/index.php?s=monkeys>`__, because that's
the kind of thing that I do sometimes; got a problem with
that\ `â€½ <http://blog.gwax.com/2008/08/20/the-interrobang/>`__ Anyway, I
happened to come across one of my old posts, which happened to remind me
of my dear old friend, `Mr.
Tickles <http://blog.gwax.com/2004/02/28/introductions-all-around/>`__.
Good Lord, he was a great fish and I, absolutely, `still miss
him <http://blog.gwax.com/2004/12/27/still-miss-him/>`__. Ditto, if not
more, for `Browder <http://blog.gwax.com/2008/06/21/rip-browder/>`__.
Thankfully, Baldr's probably got 7-9 more years in him.

Sometimes my sentimentality really catches me by surprise; I would have
thought that I was colder hearted than all this.
