Just a bit ago, I was performing a quick search of my blog for
`monkeys <http://blog.gwax.com/index.php?s=monkeys>`__, because that's
the kind of thing that I do sometimes; got a problem with
that\ `â€½ <link://slug/the-interrobang>`__ Anyway, I
happened to come across one of my old posts, which happened to remind me
of my dear old friend, `Mr.
Tickles <link://slug/introductions-all-around>`__.
Good Lord, he was a great fish and I, absolutely, `still miss
him <link://slug/still-miss-him>`__. Ditto, if not
more, for `Browder <link://slug/rip-browder>`__.
Thankfully, Baldr's probably got 7-9 more years in him.

Sometimes my sentimentality really catches me by surprise; I would have
thought that I was colder hearted than all this.
