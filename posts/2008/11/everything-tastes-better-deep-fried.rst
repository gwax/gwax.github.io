With two appliances primarily to blame, there's been a lot of great
culinary exploration and experimentation going on in my apartment of
late. Firstly, I recently purchased a hand cranked meat grinder and;
secondly, Jacob, friend of the apartment, having roommates who would not
allow a deep fryer, bought a deep fryer for our apartment. The primary
result of the meat grinder has been lots of meat loaf, which is tasty,
healthy and endlessly reheatable. The results of the deep fryer have, so
far, been: buffalo wings, onion rings and deep fried meat loaf, which
are all amazingly delicious and terribly bad for us.

We're only at the beginning, though, future plans include: duck burgers,
Fosters beer battered kangaroo nuggets, rattlesnake burgers, loaves of
every meat you can imagine and deep fried pretty much everything.
