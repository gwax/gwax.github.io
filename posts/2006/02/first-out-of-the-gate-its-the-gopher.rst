I got my first response back from a law school today; I've been accepted
at the University of Minnesota Law School. Now, I'm sure plenty of you
folks will have comic things to say about Minnesota, so I've prepared a
few retorts in advance: I have a ton of family in Minnesota; I was born
in Minnesota; I am one of those people that likes the cold; the
University of Minnesota Law School is ranked 19 in the country by
USNews.
