As many (some) of you know, I like to single out one lucky lady on
Valentine's Day and give her a cinder block. Sadly, this year, I
completely forgot about Valentine's Day and as such have not presented a
cinder block this year. This makes two years in a row that I've failed
to give out a cinder block; poor form gwax, poor form. Anyway, that's me
being a failure at Valentine's day (again); I'll try to be better about
it next year.
