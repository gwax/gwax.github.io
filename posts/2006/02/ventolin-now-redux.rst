I've been working on a policy of aim for getting to work at 9a but based
on my ability to wake up that's been translating to 9:15a on a good day
and closer to 10a on an average day. Today, one of my bosses (or
superiors or something) told me that I should be getting in closer to
9a. Honestly, I was kind of expecting this to happen at some point and
thankfully the way in which it was presented indicates that it hasn't
become an issue yet. All that said, the simple fact of the matter is
that it's find a better alarm clock time (so that I don't just press
snooze for two hours like usual). As far as alarm clocks go, there's one
perfect choice and it means going back to classics: Ventolin in the AM.
Now, by Ventolin, I don't mean the drug, I mean the Aphex Twin song. The
song is fantastically caustic (though very good) and will wake you up
like nothing else. The method I have chosen for Ventolin presentation is
the same one that I devised in high school: Winamp called with
Ventolin's mp3 as an option from a Windows Scheduled Task every weekday
morning. So yeah, if you want a surefire way to wake up in the morning,
I highly recommend Aphex Twin - Ventolin.
