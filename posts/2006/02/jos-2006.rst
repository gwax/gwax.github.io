I spent the long weekend down in Hartford, CT for the 2006 Fencing
Junior Olympics (JOs). The JOs are the largest 20 and under fencing
event in the US and they're held in a different location every year;
this year they were held in Hartford, which is so close to home that I
couldn't really justify not going. It was a lot of fun watching the
fencing, cheering for members of my club and hanging out with fencing
people. The fencing started really early every day, ran late every day
and tended to be followed by a long, late dinner, which made for very
short nights of sleeping. I would normally be fine with sleeping little
over a long weekend for an event but I was fighting a cold at the same
time, so this weekend has really taken a lot out of me. I feel mighty
drained right now, but it sure was a lot of fun and man, oh man,
watching all that fencing really makes me want to do some myself; I
can't wait for club tomorrow.
