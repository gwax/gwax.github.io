There's a fantastic new show on television in the UK right now called
the IT Crowd. The show doesn't air in the US but the first two episodes
were originally available online legally and, of course, they can all be
gotten through not so legal mean (torrents available by searching the
`pirate bay <http://thepiratebay.org/>`__). The show centers around the
IT department of a large company (two socially awkward guys and a woman
who lied her way into the job) and is fantastically funny, even if you
don't know the first thing about computers. The IT Crowd is, in my
opinion, one of the funniest shows in rather a while and you are doing
yourself a disservice if you don't give it a look.
