There's a fantastic new show on television in the UK right now called
the IT Crowd. The show centers around the IT department of a large company
(two socially awkward guys and a woman who lied her way into the job) and is
fantastically funny, even if you don't know the first thing about
computers. The IT Crowd is, in my opinion, one of the funniest shows in
rather a while and you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't give it
a look.
