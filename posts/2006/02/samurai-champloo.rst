I have just finished watching the delightful anime *Samurai Champloo*
and I would like to recommend it to all you people out there. I would
definitely rank Champloo up there with Cowboy Bebop and Trigun; in fact,
I might go as far as to say that it's the best of the three. So all you
folks out there, if you haven't seen Samurai Champloo, go get on it. Oh,
and to all the many people that recommended that I watch it, thanks (you
know who you are).
