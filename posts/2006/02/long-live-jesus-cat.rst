Anyone that's driven between Carlisle and Chelmsford more than a few
times should be well aware of Jesus Cat and I am happy to report that he
still exists. I have driven the Chelmsford-Carlisle route a number of
times recently but had not seen Jesus Cat, which had left me concerned
that he had departed this world, but on a return trip from Chelmsford
tonight, I spotted him; long live Jesus Cat.

For those that are unaware, Jesus Cat is a plush cat that has been
crucified to a telephone pole. I consider Jesus Cat to be a staple of
the Carlisle experience as he's been there since before the first time I
ever drove to Chelmsford (so at least 6 years).
