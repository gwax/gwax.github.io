As I've mentioned, I've recently gotten back into fencing, which I'm
having rather a bit of fun with, and it's led me to an interesting
opportunity. I've started directing/refereeing for small local
tournaments (mostly high school competitions), which, in addition to
being something fun, is something they pay me for. In spite of the fact
that I'm not anywhere near as good at fencing as I used to be, I'm still
plenty good at watching it and knowing what's going on and it's a whole
lot of fun. That they're paying me is almost icing on the cake.
