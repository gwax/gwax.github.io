I've tried many of these but I just can't do the massage as I have a
2009 iMac which has a glass panel in front of the screen so I can't
touch the pixels. What can I do? Apple have an up to 8 defective pixels
for me to get it replaced and I only have 1 pixel stuck bright blue a
few inches from the bottom of the screen.
