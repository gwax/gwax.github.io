It's been a while since I've mentioned my experiments adding acetone to
my trucks fuel tank, so just to prevent you thinking I'd given up on the
matter, here's an update. I've improved the algorithms I'm using in my
Excel spreadsheet because I was bored, so now I compensate for remaining
acetone as a result of refilling before the tank it empty, volume of
acetone added and I get rather more informative analyses. Additionally,
I've added a more data points, putting me at 17 tanks of fuel on the
chart. Currently, data suggests a near linear economy increase for my
truck of about 7% at 0.15% acetone concentration (1MPG at 1/3 cup
acetone). This linear increase isn't showing any signs of leveling off,
so I'm going to start pushing the concentration up in the next few
tanks. I'll give you a better write up with more manageable units when
I'm satisfied that I've found the acetone concentration of maximal
economy for my truck. I expect that I'll probably repeat this experiment
with my next vehicle, and every vehicle thereafter for that matter (as
long as they still run on petrol).
