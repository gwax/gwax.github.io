My friend Dave tells the story of hitting a deer in their bigass truck
while towing race cars back from a race (he is/was on the pit crew); one
of the other dudes, using the tire iron, did exactly as you've
described, but since it was in a relatively deep ditch, Dave's
perspective on it was limited to the rise and fall of the iron, almost
as if in a horror movie.

But yeah, hitting deer definitely sucks.
