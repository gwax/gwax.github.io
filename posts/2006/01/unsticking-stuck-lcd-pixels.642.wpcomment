update: i ran the gif image, the fastest one just over the defective
pixel all night and it still hasn't fixed the pixel, so im going to talk
to the store i bought it from and see if they can send a new one, if not
I'll return it on my 14 days distans buying law that applied when buying
over the internet and phone.
