At the top of my list of reasons that I should be in L.A. next month is
that the Kids in the Hall are doing a three night reunion thing in L.A.
next month. The reunion is only being publicized `through the
blogosphere <http://kithblog.tripod.com/>`__ and by word of mouth and
will be at the `Steve Allen Theater <http://www.cfiwest.org/theater/>`__
in L.A. on February 23, 24 and 25. Anyway, you lucky folks out in the
L.A. area had better get yourself to that show and tell me that it was
the awesomest thing you've ever seen; while you're at that, I think I'll
just spend some time wishing they'd come to Boston or New York.
