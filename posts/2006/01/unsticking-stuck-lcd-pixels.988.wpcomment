Thank you!!! I just got a brand new LG 25.5" W2600H and it had a pixel
stuck green right in the middle of the screen. I tried both 3 and 5 with
some strong pressure and rubbing and I took my finger away and pop, it
disappeared. You are a saint! Since newegg only takes it back if it has
8 dead pixels I woulda been screwed.
