Until just a little earlier today, I was scheduled to go on a business
trip down to Savannah, GA but as a result of intercorporate politics
between the customer I was going to be dealing with and another company,
they've asked that we put things off a little bit. It's kind of
unfortunate because I was looking forward to going to Georgia for a few
days. Oh well, at least it's snowing here; maybe I'll go sledding later.
