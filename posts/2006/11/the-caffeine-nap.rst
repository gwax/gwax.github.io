A long while ago, I read about the concept of a `caffeine
nap <http://www.persistenceunlimited.com/2006/02/how-to-take-a-caffeine-nap/>`__
and then promptly didn't give it another thought. Today, however, I
revisited the topic inadvertently. Finding myself rather tired from last
night's minimal quantity of sleep, I was waiting from about 1:30 for my
2:30 class and falling asleep. I had, in my possession, a mostly full
bottle of Vault Zero, and by 2:00 my ability to keep my eyes open had
approached nil. Thinking that I might as well try to take a 15-20 minute
power nap, I vaguely recalled what I had read long ago and decided that
I might as well pound the remainder of my beverage before my nap.
Surprisingly, I found the caffeine nap to be dramatically more effective
than any other 15-20 minute nap that I've ever taken. I may just have to
consider the option of caffeine naps more seriously in the future.
