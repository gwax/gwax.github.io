Well, not so much Dodge as Minneapolis but the point is the same. As I
write this, I am in Chi-town visiting my friend Jamie. I'd been meaning
to get out of Minneapolis in a "get away from it all" for a while sense
and I've been wanting to pull a big road trip for a few weeks. So, when
I discovered that I had an old friend 6 hours drive away, I found a
brilliant means of satiating my desires. As it stands, I haven't been
doing altogether too much her but relaxing with a change of scenery and
people is really nice. Of course, I'm not terribly looking forward to
the amount of work that I'll have to do tomorrow night but it's worth it
so, so be it.
