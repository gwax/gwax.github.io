As the clock ticks over to 6am, it occurs to me that I'm pulling more
all-nighters here in law school than I ever did at MIT. I used to pull
all-nighters every once in a while at MIT, sometimes out of necessity
and sometimes just for the heck of it. All told, I probably averaged one
or two all-nighters for every few months during my undergrad career. So
far in law school, I'm probably averaging one or two per couple weeks.
To compensate my lack of sleeping, I've taken up a fairly regular
napping regimen; Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, from the end of
Contracts (10am) until lunch, I usually take a nap in one of the chairs
of the law school sub-plaza. It's probably not a good system but it
works well enough and I've only got about a month left.
