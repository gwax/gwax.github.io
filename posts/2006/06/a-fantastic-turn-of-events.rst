In what I find to be a surprisingly fortuitous turn, I've found a girl
who satisfies my `criteria for a
woman <link://slug/what-am-i-looking-for-in-a-woman>`__
(all the requisite ones and a bit more). On top of meeting all the
criteria I laid out way back when, she's full of charming eccentricities
and is a whole lot of fun to hang out with. Continuing with great
things, she studies video game design as a grad student at MIT; let me
reitterate, she studies video games. Oh, and just to round things out a
little, she's absolutely, drop dead gorgeous; I'm talking at least three
standard deviations out the general population curve for beauty here.

I guess my numbers must have came up in the karmic lottery or something.
