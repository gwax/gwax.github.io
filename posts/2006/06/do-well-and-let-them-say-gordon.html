        For those of you that don't know, I've got a fair bit of Scotch coursing
        through my veins; that's ancestry, not whisky. I derive my Scottish
        ancestry from my father's mother, who was of Meldrum decent. Having some
        free time recently, I decided to pick the Internet's electronic scow of
        a brain to see if I couldn't find out a little about my Scottish
        heritage.

    <p>
        It turns out that the Meldrums are a sept of Clan Gordon, which goes on
        to mean that I am a member of Clan Gordon. Having looked around a bit, I
        have succeeded in identifying the coat of arms for Clan Gordon (left),
        the coat of arms for the Meldrum Sept (right) and Clan Gordon's tartan
        (the post background is the ancient variant of the tartan).

    <p>
        Those of you who know me know that the next thing that I would do is
        determine whether the Meldrums or the Gordons were associated with any
        particular distillery. The Gordon's are loosely associated with The
        Speyside single malt whisky and strongly associated with the liquer
        <a href="http://www.cockothenorth.com/">Cock O' The North</a>. I have had The
        Speyside before and as far as good Scotches go, it's pretty mediocre.
        Cock O' The North seemed interesting enough to me that I decided to get
        some shipped across the pond to me so as I could give it a try. The
        liquer is a mixture of The Speyside, Blaeberry (closely related to
        blueberry) and a secret ingredient (known to the head of Clan Gordon and
        his eldest son). Having recently received my order of Cock O' The North,
        I can tell you this: it is fantastic. The liquer is unbelievably smooth
        considering its potency, fairly sweet and has a very delicate, pleasant
        bouquet of flavors. Cock O' The North is really fantastic, the first sip
        I had was just wow and every time I have a sip; I'm sure, without
        contest, that it is the best alcoholic beverage I have ever had. Fancy
        that, geneological investigations lead me to an incredible liquer.

        Oh yeah, sorry about the legibility on this one; I tried pretty hard but
        I couldn't find a font color that worked over this background.
