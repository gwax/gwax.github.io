I've started watching the daily vlog (please tell me I'm not becoming
hip) `Rocketboom <http://www.rocketboom.com/>`__ because it covers
issues that interest me in a style that I like and the host(ess) is
cute. I mention this to you today both because I've been watching it
long enough to think that it's worth mentioning to the rest of you and
because they actually did something that caused me to pause and take
note. `Today's
Rocketboom <http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/06/rb_06_jun_23.html>`__
is probably the best piece I have yet seen on the topic of net
neutrality; don't get me wrong, `Ask A Ninja <http://askaninja.com/>`__
did a fine `piece on net
neutrality <http://www.askaninja.com/news/2006/05/11/ask-a-ninja-special-delivery-4-net-neutrality>`__
too but the piece by Rocketboom does a really good job of explaining why
net neutrality is a really important issue and why everyone needs to
tell their governmental representatives to keep our internet free. I
really don't want to find myself, ten years from now, lamenting over the
way the internet used to be.
