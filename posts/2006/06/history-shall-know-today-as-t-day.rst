Today is a historic day in the computing world of George; today I have
broken the 1 terabyte mark. I've had some minor issues with a few (4) of
my hard drives recently, so between my data packrat tendencies and the
current price of hard drives, I went out and bought a pair of 300GB hard
drives. What, a pair of 300GB hard drives, ludicrous you say? Not so, I
always buy hard drives in pairs so that I can stripe them as `RAID
0 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID#RAID_0>`__ arrays; it's a
principle, habit and policy thing of mine, so pairs. Also, if I'd gotten
any less than 500GB, I wouldn't have enough space to resolve my current
hard drive issues so as to be able to burn DVDs and reformat everything.
Anyway, adding 600GB to thevoid's current 480GB brings her to a grand
total of 1080GB, which makes thevoid my first computer to break out of
the sub-terabyte world. Doing a quick tally over all of my various
datastores, thevoid at 1080GB, hobosphere at 160GB, r-type at 4GB
(*snicker*), ~400 blank and used CD-Rs making 280GB, ~300 blank and used
DVD-Rs and DVD+Rs making 1350GB, my current data capacity is sitting
pretty near a whopping 2.8TB; man I love big numbers!

In thinking about how much space I now have on one computer (thevoid),
it occurs to me that it might very well be time to start putting
Operation Dreadnought in action (cue ominous music).
