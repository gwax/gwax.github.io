Earlier today (technically yesterday) I informed my boss that I will be
leaving Innov-X Systems at the end of the month. I was expecting it to
be rather unpleasant but in reality that was all my fear of certain
types of confrontation (that's gotten me into some trouble in the past).
My boss was really cool and understanding about the whole thing; he's a
good guy in general really. In fact, the whole company is full of really
good people and for that matter it will be a little sad to leave. I have
been fortunate to have a pleasant, if short tenure in my first, and
likely last, corporate engineering position. Oh well, such is the path I
have chosen to tread. Soon it will be off for a brief term of
unemployment followed by the road to a law degree and the "Esquire"
post-nominal.
