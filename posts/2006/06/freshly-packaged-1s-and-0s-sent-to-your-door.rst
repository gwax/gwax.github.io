Between work and having hard drive problems at home, I've started
listening to a lot of streaming internet radio and I've had some pretty
good results. For a while I was on an NPR kick, listening to
`WBUR <http://www.wbur.org/listen/>`__ (my local NPR) and having a
pretty good time with that. As is inevitably the case with me, I got
tired of hearing old news and went in search of a decent music stream.
In the past I'd had rather poor luck with finding a music stream to my
liking but this is no longer the past. I stopped by `Digitally Imported
Internet Radio <http://di.fm/>`__ (di.fm) to see what they have to offer
these days. Looking at what DI has to offer, ignoring the ones I know I
don't much like, I decided to give their `Chillout
Stream <http://di.fm/mp3/chillout.pls>`__ [.pls] a try and I have got to
say, I am mighty pleased. DI sort of fell out of my favor a few years
back when they were still playing mostly trance and most trance happened
to turn into crap. In the intervening years DI added more streams, none
of which quite grabbed me, but now this Chillout stream is really
hitting me as just my sort of thing. They've even played a couple songs
that I know and am quite partial to: Peace of Mind by Dark Soho and
Behind Closed Eyelids by Shpongle. Color me pleased DI.

Now, if only there were some way that I could get this in my car.
