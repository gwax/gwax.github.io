The insanely awesome (awesomely insane?) television show Wonder Showzen
is back for season 2. My first experience with Wonder Showzen was in the
form of a wonderful little file that I came across on, the now defunct,
suprnova that had a file name of kidshow2.wmv and a description of "kids
show (not for kids)". Kids Show turned out to be a pilot episode, which
got picked up by MTV2 and turned into the glory that is Wonder Showzen.
The entirety of Wonder Showzen season 1 was pure genius and hopefully
season 2 will meet the high expectations set forth for it.

Now, we all know copyright violation is bad, so it would be unethical
for me to tell you whether or not `mininova <http://mininova.org/>`__
can help you find torrents relating to previously aired episodes of
Wonder Showzen and, as such, I won't (tell you if you can find Wonder
Showzen torrents at `mininova <http://mininova.org/>`__, that is).
