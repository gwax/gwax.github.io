This evening I watched The Paper Chase with a few of the other law
students here. For those of you that don't know, The Paper Chase is
about a few law students (one in particular) going through their first
year at Harvard Law School, with a particular focus on their contracts
class (and it's professor). If you would like to get some idea of what
law school is like, I recommend watching this movie as it has a lot of
very accurate elements. In spite of its accuracy, The Paper Chase does
not match up with my experience in a few key ways: none of my professors
are quite as mean as Professor Kingsfield and none of my classmates are
quite as self-servingly cutthroat as most of the other students in the
movie. The movie does, however, give a seemingly accurate portrayal of
the workload, class structure, stress levels, sleep deprivation and
general style of the experience. I should like to add the caveat to
everything previously said in this post that I've only finished one
month of my first term and things could change dramatically between now
and finals.
