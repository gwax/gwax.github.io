So apparently there's also this thing called presbyopia, which is a
hardening of the lenses with time, so that your near point and far point
become closer together. Everybody gets it and it sets on at a linear
rate with age. Anyone who doesn't have glasses by age 50 is a magician.

P.S. Contacts are an option too. And yes, your blue eyes are sexy.
