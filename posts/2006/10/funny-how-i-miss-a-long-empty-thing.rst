I was walking back from grabbing a bite to eat and a caffeinated
beverage and the return trip had me passing down a hallway when I was
suddenly struck by how very short the hallway was. Well, long story
short, I found myself missing MIT's Infinite Corridor. When I'm next in
Massachusetts, I'll have to make a point of walking down that hallway.
