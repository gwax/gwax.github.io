My inspiration was that someone gave me a few Tootsie Pops at one point
and I said to myself, hey, I should figure out how many licks it takes
to get to the Tootsie Roll center of these things and I should do so in
a scientific manner.

The call was really no bother either, I'm glad to help out inquiring
minds however I can.
