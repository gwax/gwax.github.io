I have, just recently, gotten a spiffy
`Speakeasy <http://www.speakeasy.net/>`__ DSL connection installed at my
home for my personal use. The DSL connection provides me with
3.0Mbps/768kbps (up/down) speeds and a number of static IP addresses,
which means that I can finally move my server out of an MIT closet. This
move will take a few hours during which time my server will be
completely down and then there will be a lag time as the DNS servers are
updated to reflect the change. So, what I'm saying is, expect a day or
so of downtime for all of gwax.[com,net,org], including mail services,
sometime in the near future.

After the migration, there'll be another fun server happening, namely a
rather big upgrade. I've been thinking of upgrading my server since I
got a properly paying job and I happened to be browsing the `Dell
website <http://www.dell.com/>`__ when I noticed that they were selling
rather fancy equipment at rather large discounts. Long story short, in a
couple weeks, I should have a brand-spanking new Dell PowerEdge SC430
server with a 2.8GHz Dual Core Pentium D, 1GB DDR2 RAM and 160GB SATA
Hard Drive space, which was discounted from $976 to $499. This machine
is going to be an absolute beast, totally blowing all of my other
computers out of the water (there's Moore's Law for you). So, after that
beast arrives, I'll get it set up with all of the services that my
current server provides, slowly migrate serving responsibilities over
(which ought to be transparent to all of you) and then retire my current
server to some other menial task.

There is, of course, one question left to answer: what should I name my
new machine?
