I've recently been rethinking my standpoint on heroes and, as a result,
have added a couple new ones to my personal list. My current list of
heroes is as follows (in no particular order):

-  `Joshua A. Norton <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_A._Norton>`__
-  `The Tick <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tick>`__
-  `Optimus Prime <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime>`__
-  `Miyamoto Musashi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi>`__
-  `Bruce Lee <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee>`__

Fictional or real, all truly admirable individuals.
