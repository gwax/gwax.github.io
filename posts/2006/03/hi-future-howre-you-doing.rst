If you're the type of person who likes the idea of trying to send a
message to whoever's on this planet 50,000 years from now (and I know
that I am), you might be interested in `adding a message to
KEO <http://www.keo.org/uk/pages/message.php>`__.
`KEO <http://www.keo.org/>`__ is a satellite that some European space
folks are tossing up to be a time capsule, which is designed to reenter
and land 50,000 years from now, disgorging a whole bunch of information.
They're letting every person on the planet contribute up to 6000
characters to be put into the capsule. I'm going to see if I can come up
with something good to add; I'm thinking I'll probably put something
really inane in, like my joke about the two monkeys that walk into a
bar, the silly clown joke or something similar.
