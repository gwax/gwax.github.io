I just recently watched the fantastic anime, *Steamboy*, which I highly
recommend. There were two things that initially drew me to Steamboy: it
was directed by Katsuhiro Otomo (of Akira and Memories fame) and it's
steampunk. Steampunk is a sub-genre of a type of fiction that I really
like; the term is derivative of cyberpunk but instead of being an
imagining of where electronics will take us, it is an imagining of where
steam power would have taken people of the industrial revolution.
Steampunk is one of the many sorts of fiction based around the idea of
applying a fantastic science fiction lens to some period of history.
Another example of such a sub-genre that I'm quite partial to is Science
fiction Westerns, which includes such great works as *The Adventures of
Brisco County, Jr.*. There are a plethora of other such sub-genres and
works, which I could yammer on about but it's time to get back to the
central themes of this post, Steamboy and Steampunk. Steampunk does the
truly wonderful job of creating all sorts of bizarre contraptions and
machines that aren't science fiction because you could almost conceive
them being built today, or even a century ago and then throwing these
machines at you in all their glory, making you want to go out and
construct them in your workshop, or for that matter, get myself a
workshop to build stuff in. Steampunk is a genre that wows and, in this
regard, Steamboy does not disappoint. The early devices one comes across
in the movie are a little fantastical, but not the least bit beyond
feasibility and for the most part, everything remains mostly within the
realm of what could be done, though there are some elements that push
things well beyond the pale. Ignoring the machines, the art is very well
done and the story is quite good, though the central theme does get a
little overfocused at times. All in all, Steamboy is a truly wonderful
movie and you should all do yourselves the favor of watching it.
