The internet has provided me with proof that the Japanese are
super-humans who are going to take over the world. Just look at how they
`fold
shirts <http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4776825453418327083>`__,
`peel potatoes <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37GVvxcyz6I>`__ and `do
everything else <http://www.youtube.com/results?related=urawaza>`__.
Seriously, I watched the shirt folding video at least five times and was
still left completely agog.
