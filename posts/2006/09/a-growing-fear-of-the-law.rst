Whilst I had previously found myself totally at ease about going to law
school, in the past day or so I have started to develop some very strong
apprehensions. Quite frankly, I'm flat out terrified right now. I am
aware that my fear is simply a fear of the unknown but that provides me
little solace and I am left plodding forward and hoping it turns out to
not be that bad. There are really three matters that contribute to my
fear: grading, participation and homework. Grading is done in a manner
that I am unaccustomed to, namely there's a final and nothing else; my
entire grade for each class will be determined by a single test that I
take in three and a half months. Although participation essentially
doesn't contribute to my grades, I am not looking forward to the
Socratic method of calling out and grilling students; that said, it may
turn out not to be as bad as I currently think. As for homework, class
has not yet begun and I already have about forty pages of reading with
some writing assignments due for each of my classes and if I'm getting
this much before class begins, I'm a little concerned about how much
work I will have later. I'm glad that this fear has only just set in as
I'll get some relief once classes get underway in two days but I'd
certainly prefer if the fear wasn't here to begin with. Anyway, I mostly
just wanted to vent and get my apprehensions out of my head but I'll
keep you folks posted on how things turn out as time passes.
