Muckrunner and tortfeasor are currently my two favorite words (though
one isn't really a word). Tortfeasor is a genuine and real word,
muckrunner is a compound word derived from a misinterpretation of a
homophone. So as to allow you to enjoy your expanded vocabularies, I
present, without further ado, the definition and derivation of
tortfeasor and muckrunner (respectively):

*Tortfeasor :* One who has committed a tort. For those that don't know,
a tort is a civil wrong that is not a breach of contract or, in other
words, those things that people sue each other for all the time. Thus, a
tortfeasor is someone who has wronged someone else in a non-breach of
contract sort of way. Mostly though, it just sounds really neat.

*Muckrunner :* Derived from the term *running amok*, which is sometimes
written *running amuck*. Running amok is to act in a violent, murderous
frenzy and can be considered roughly synonymous with *going postal* or
*killing spree*. Based on running amuck sounding an awful lot like
running a muck, I figured that one who runs a muck might be a muckrunner
and thus the derivation is obtained. When, however, one drops the
original meaning of running amok, a muckrunner can become a totally
different thing entirely. Imagine, if you will, a man driving an old
rusty pickup truck filled to the brim with some indescribable muck; now,
further imagine this man driving down old dirt roads in a breakneck,
Dukes of Hazzard style much like the prohibition era smugglers. Although
muckrunner is an improper derivation of running amok, I find it to be a
wonderfully amusing construct.
