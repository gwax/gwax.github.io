Having experimented with margarita preparation a bit this weekend, I
feel that I have come up with a perfect recipe for a non-purists
margarita. Feeling as I do about cocktail preparation, I have foregone
the use of the abominations that are premade margarita mixes but as pure
as my cocktail preparation intentions are, my recipe does not make use
of freshly squeezed lime, so I cannot truly consider it a proper
margarita recipe. That said, I think the results do speak for
themselves:

Ingredients:

-  :sup:`3`/:sub:`4` cup Tequila
-  :sup:`3`/:sub:`4` cup Triple Sec
-  1 cup (half can) frozen Limeade Concentrate
-  Ice
-  Margarita Salt

Preparation:

In a 2 liter blender, combine Tequila, Triple Sec and Limeade
Concentrate. Add enough Ice to fill blender. Cover and blend. Serve in
glass rimmed with margarita salt. (To rim a glass with margarita salt,
take two wide, flat bowls, fill one with 1/4 inch water and the other
with 1/4 inch margarita salt, then dip a glass, rim first, in the water
followed by the salt)

Variations:

As variations on the above recipe, the Triple Sec may be replaced with
any orange liqueur. Blue Cura√ßao, for example, will make for an equally
tasty but very blue margarita. Of course, Grand Marnier or any other
orange liqueur is also acceptable.
