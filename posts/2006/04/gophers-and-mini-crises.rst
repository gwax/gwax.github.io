After some deliberation and whatnot, I have decided to attend the
University of Minnesota School of Law next year. I've been thinking
about this quite a bit since I first got my acceptance letter from them
and I'm really looking forward to this whole law school in the Twin
Cities thing. There have, however, been a couple of bumps in the road of
my mind already.

The first mini-crisis that I encountered happened when I was writing the
address on the envelope of my acceptance reply. Things were uneventful
until I hit the address zip code, 55455, which hit me like a cosh in the
back of my skull. For as long as I can remember having a zip code, it's
been a 0####: 01742 - Concord, 02543 - Woods Hole, 02139/02141 -
Cambridge. I am moving away in a fundamentally different way than I have
before; I will be well over a thousand miles from any of my home ground.

The second mini-crisis hit me right after an IRC discussion about Magic
cards; I know it's ultra-geeky but that's what struck me. I am going off
to law school and leaving the world of engineering and science; this
won't be MIT where, even if they won't admit it, everyone is a huge
geek. I am going to have to find cultural context that doesn't rely on
Magic cards and computers; I guess it's a good thing that everyone plays
Halo.

Now, don't get me wrong, I see these mini-crises as a good sign, not a
bad one. Since, change and varied experience are central elements of my
desire, being struck by the magnitude of certain changes means that I'm
going in precisely the right direction. Besides, Minnesota is cold, gets
tons of snow and gophers are almost as awesome as monkeys.
