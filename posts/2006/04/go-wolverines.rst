Communists invade Colorado, Patrick Swayze and the high school football
team fight back. The plot is brilliant, the execution is brilliant and
this is one of the finest movies ever produced... ever.

I am, of course, talking about the movie Red Dawn. I first saw the movie
about 6 years ago and, at the time, only half appreciated its epic glory
but now I have gone back, rewatched Red Dawn and am prepared to say that
this movie is a work of genius; those of you that have not seen it
should seek it out by all means possible. This has been gwax's public
service announcement of the some recent time period.
