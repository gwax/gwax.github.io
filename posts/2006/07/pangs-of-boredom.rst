Having been sitting around doing nothing in Woods Hole for nearly a
month, I have been pleased with my ability to avoid boredom and going
stir crazy. Sadly, I have been feeling the initial pangs of boredom
recently and I worry that restlessness might set in soon. On the
positive side, I don't think that I have been this relaxed and generally
at peace in over half a decade but I think that I might have hit my
limit. Hopefully, I can drag out the relaxing for another couple of
weeks and take off before boredom really sets in.
