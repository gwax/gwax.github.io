It is now well into the summer and, having quit my job, I once again
find myself in the stronghold of relaxation that is Woods Hole. In
previous years I held positions that put me in close proximity with
computers but this summer, such is not the case; I am running without my
constant information net and I'm liking it. I am living a pleasant and
unfettered life right now and I will probably not be updating my blog
very often. So, if any of you find yourselves wondering if I've dropped
off the face of the Earth, the answer is sort of, but I'll still answer
my phone.
