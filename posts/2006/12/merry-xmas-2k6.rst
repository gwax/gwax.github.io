For those of you that don't
`recall <http://blog.gwax.com/2004/12/25/merry-xmas-2k4/>`__ the
`past <http://blog.gwax.com/2005/12/25/merry-xmas-2k5/>`__, I'm usually
not a big fan of Christmas. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it
is usually a holiday that I do not like. It's really all misery that I
bring upon myself by being overly puristic with regards to principles of
gifting. As far as I'm concerned, a gift is meant to express your
understanding of the recipient and, as such, the giftee shouldn't tell
the gifter what is desired. The end result, for me, is usually that I am
disappointed to discover that I have received nothing that I wanted and
am left with the feeling that nobody understands me. Of course, it
probably doesn't help that I rarely have something that I actually want
so people are left having to get me something that I want without my
giving them any hints and without my really having any idea what sort of
thing I might want to begin with. Yeah, great system I've got, make
people find a gift that I want but don't know it. In case it wasn't
obvious, I am generally not a fan of my birthday either.

This year, however, I decided to take a different approach to Christmas.
Instead of hoping that people would get me appropriate gifts and having
my hopes dashed, as on a rock, I approached this holiday without hopes.
The direct effect of this year's approach is that I'm not bitter for
lack of proper gifts, but there's the side-effect that I really don't
know whether I'm pleased by this year's omnium-gatherum or not. For
those of you out there that feel like pointing, calling Scrooge and
saying that I've lost the Christmas spirit, I really don't care. I'm
pretty sure that I lost the Christmas spirit many years ago and, if
approaching the holiday dispassionately means that I'm not sad and
bitter, I'm fine with giving up the hope of getting a good gift.

In closing, bah humbug.
