Earlier this evening I had the opportunity to attend a house party
hosted by one of my high school classmates. As with most parties of the
sort that I have ever attended, the reality was that I was mostly out of
my element, though, if you ask me, I think that I did a pretty decent
job of faking it. Tonight, though, I made an interesting observation
about my own propensities as regards social interactions in such a
setting; I'd far prefer to have one interesting conversation over any
number of less interesting ones. I happened to find myself in a
conversation with another one of my high school classmates at this party
who was in a fairly technically/scientifically advanced field. The
conversation began, as many of the evening did, with my
half-interestedly asking what she was up to now and her responding and
general cordiality and whatnot. The conversation continued a little and
I found myself genuinely interested in what it was that she was up to
but the conversation never really got too far past the generic. I tried,
barely really, to steer the conversation in a direction such that it
might involve interesting technical details but she was having none of
it.

I ask you, Internet, is it unreasonable for me to want to have a
scientific conversation at a house party? Is it weird for me to want to
know what someone is studying/researching to a real extent? Am I a huge
nerd?
