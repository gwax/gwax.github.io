I want to share with you a term that my good friend
`Riad <http://blog.jfet.org>`__--whom you might also know as
Weebles--recently chimerized out of the various holidays that pop up
around this time of year. The term is Chrishanukkwanzaastice and I am of
the opinion that it deserves a place with those other hallowed holidays
(`Hanukkah <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah>`__,
`Crimbo <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimbo>`__,
`Kwanzaa <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwanzaa>`__,
`Festivus <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus>`__,
`Solstice <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Solstice_Celebration>`__,
`Christmas <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas>`__,
`Saturnalia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia>`__ and the like).
Anyway, I wanted to share the new holiday with you and thank Weebles for
his truly enlightened skills of derivation.

Merry Chrishanukkwanzaastice to all!
