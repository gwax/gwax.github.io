Continuing `my earlier work </2010/10/28/ironhide-cocktail-recipe/>`__
in the realm of mixology, I would like to present my second cocktail
invention. The invention of this cocktail is the result of playing
around with gin,
`Chartreuse <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartreuse_%28liqueur%29>`__,
`St.
Germain <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Germain_%28liqueur%29>`__, and
various other liqueurs in an attempt to make something tasty. This
cocktail earns its name, Will O' The Wisp, from its faint, ghostly,
green color.

**Ingredients:**

-  3/4 oz Green Chartreuse
-  3/4 oz St. Germain
-  3/4 oz White Vermouth
-  1 dash Lavender Bitters
-  3 oz Dry Gin
-  1/4 oz Herbsaint or Absinth

**Recipe:**

#. Pour the Chartreuse, St. Germain, Vermouth, Bitters, and Gin into a
   cocktail shaker
#. Pour the Herbsaint/Absinth into a chilled cocktail glass
#. Swirl the cocktail glass, coating the sides, and pouring off any
   excess Herbsaint/Absinth
#. Add ice to the cocktail shaker and shake
#. Pour shaken cocktail into the prepared glass

**Notes:** The Herbsaint/Absinth can be skipped, though I don't
recommend it. The Lavender Bitters are also optional but very highly
recommended. I would recommend stirring this cocktail (instead of
shaking) as the resulting beverage has a very different appearance.
