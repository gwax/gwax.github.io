Before making any claims to having coined a term, it is generally a good
idea to check that no one else has used the term before. Having just
spent three hours and change reading through articles on the `Warhammer
40K Wiki <http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Warhammer_40k_Wiki>`__
(what can I say, I like super far future science fiction), I couldn't
help but feel like I'd been stuck in a black hole of trivial knowledge.
This wiki-triggered and wiki-fed hole in time was not a unique
experience for me; I have fallen into these before on other wikis in the
past.

Having freed myself, the term "wiki hole" came to mind as a perfect term
to describe. Not wanting to make any (easily refutable) ridiculous
claims, I performed a couple quick google searches
(`1 <http://www.google.com/#q=wiki+hole>`__
`2 <http://www.google.com/#q=wikihole>`__) only to find that the term
`already
exists <http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wiki-hole>`__. I
can't say that I'm particularly surprised that someone else has already
coined the term "wiki-hole"--it is phenomenally intuitive--but I am glad
that my linguistic instincts were reasonable.
