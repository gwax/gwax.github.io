In modern American political discourse, a great many individuals have
been making the claim that America was founded by Christians as a nation
built upon Christian morality. Somehow, mind-bogglingly, these claims
are made in spite of the existence of the `Establishment
Clause <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause>`__ of the
`First
Amendment <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution>`__
to the `United States
Constitution <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution>`__:

   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
   or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

I was recently pointed to a new argument against the Christian Nation
idea in the form of `the Treaty of
Tripoli <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli>`__, which
contains, as Article 11, the text:

   As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any
   sense, founded on the Christian religion,—as it has in itself no
   character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of
   Mussulmen,—and as the said States never entered into any war or act
   of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the
   parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever
   produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two
   countries.

Not that the wingnuts that would make such absurd claims would listen to
reason but the Treaty of Tripoli was unanimously ratified by the US
Senate and signed into law by John Adams in 1797. That the Treaty of
Tripoli dates to 21 years after US independence and 9 years after the US
Constitution makes it a pretty clear indicator of both national
sentiment and the intent of the founding fathers, what with them still
being around and all.

Maybe I should start taking a more `militantly
atheistic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_atheism>`__ stance to
my personal philosophy.
