A couple nights ago, I started my first playtest session for my new, as yet
untitled, solo rpg. By the end of the attempt, I hadn't managed much in the
way of play but I had gotten some worldbuilding in and I had a rather good
time. I learned some useful things about scale of game and where to start.

The goal at the outset was to make an initial city, set out a PC in the city,
introduce an NPC, and have one interaction. Too ambitious, maybe, but being
unambitious is a recipe for failure.

I had figured a city was a good starting layer but it ended up being too hard
to fill out all of the details or figure out where to start. I managed to
establish a concept of districts, so my plan for my next session is to work
out a system for generating small towns and play a game that operates on the
layer of a town or a series of towns. Once I've tested that a bit, I'll step
up to the city layer and use the town generation system to generate districts
within a city.

I noted down my session through a series of Google Drive documents and photos
of drawings arranged in four groups: Rules, World Catalog, Log, and Notes.

Session notes below the fold...

Rules
-----

Start with a blank slate (we do not know our character), 3 core attributes
all at rank 3:

-   Physique (can be specialized as Strength, Speed, Resistance)
-   Intellect (can be specialized as Education, Fortitude, Judgement)
-   Culture (can be specialized as Charisma, Standing, Resources)

All standard skills at 0, special skills at X (blank slate, we will fill in
with lifepath flashbacks later)

Choose a setting: write this in your world catalog

-   For run 1, we are going to go with a sort of Steampunk Noir set in an
    alternate History USA
-   Set (or at least starting) in a single metropolitan city

Roll up a city:

-   We use a system derived from: https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/in-corpathium/

-   Cities will probably vary in scale in the future (somehow) but for now,
    let’s take: 1d4, 3d6, 1d8, 2d10, 1d12, 3d20

-   Roll them all on a piece of paper at the same time; if any fall off, roll
    them back on; these will be your neighborhoods/boroughs/districts/what
    have you

        :alt: Roll your city


-   Spread the dice out a little, being careful not to their face or relative
    position; if you can, try to maintain their orientation; try to center
    them on the paper

    .. thumbnail:: /images/posts/2020/06/session01-citygen02-spreaddice.jpg
        :alt: Spread out the dice a little

-   Draw lines between nearby, adjacent dice; if you aren’t sure where to draw
    lines, look at the face of the dice and draw lines vaguely perpendicular
    to a corner of the face

    .. thumbnail:: /images/posts/2020/06/session01-citygen03-districtboundaries.jpg
        :alt: Draw interdistrict boundaries

-   Remove the dice and write their face number in their place (right under
    the die)

    .. thumbnail:: /images/posts/2020/06/session01-citygen04-removedice.jpg
        :alt: Remove dice and record numbers

-   Draw polygons around each, making sure polygons only touch where you have
    previously drawn lines between them; this is your city’s connectedness;
    gaps will be parks or other natural features

    .. thumbnail:: /images/posts/2020/06/session01-citygen05-drawdistricts.jpg
        :alt: Draw district lines

-   Find the lowest numbered district and mark it as district “A”

    -   Resolve ties randomly (by rolling dice or whatever)

-   Find the next lowest numbered district and mark it “B”

    -   In the event of a tie, the winner is the closest by center-to-center
        die position to district A; if there’s still a tie, determine randomly

-   Repeat for all remaining districts “C”, “D”, “E”, …

    -   Ties always go to the closest to A

    .. thumbnail:: /images/posts/2020/06/session01-citygen06-letterdistricts.jpg
        :alt: Letter districts

-   District “A” receives a district value equal to the rolled die face; mark
    this next to the letter and cross out the rolled die number (to avoid
    confusion)

-   District “B” receives a district value equal to the value of district “A”
    plus the rolled die face; mark this next to the letter and cross out the
    rolled die number

-   District “C” receives a district value equal to the value of district “B”
    plus the rolled die face; mark this next to the letter and cross out the
    rolled die number

-   And so on for the remaining districts

    .. thumbnail:: /images/posts/2020/06/session01-citygen07-scoredistricts.jpg
        :alt: Score districts

-   At this point, you may want to clean up or redraw your map; make sure to
    maintain connections, gaps, district labels and district values

    -   You may consider the map to be geographic or abstract, as long as
        connections and gaps are maintained

    .. thumbnail:: /images/posts/2020/06/session01-citygen08-redrawdistricts.jpg
        :alt: Clean up map

-   Record your city in your World catalog

-   Zone your city

    -   Mark your highest district as “x” to denote the civic center
    -   Starting with “A” and moving up, mark districts as “r”, “c”, “i” to
        denote residential, commercial, industrial; repeat until you reach x

Find your home district:

-   Roll 3D6, your home district is the lowest valued district >= your role,
    mark your roll in the log and mark it as home in the catalog

Choose your purpose:

-   Select from setting purposes and mark it in your catalog character section

Design Ideas

District values correlates to wealth? 0-10 = slum, 11-20 = blue collar, 20-30 = white collar, and up...
