We here in the Bay Area have been under shelter in place orders for quite a
while at this point and, even with my family around, it's pretty isolating.

In my various late evening digging around the Internet sessions, I stumbled
across the notion of solo PnP gaming. I was initially intrigued by the premise
of `Journey Back <https://rebelle-de-jour.itch.io/journey-back>`_
(unreleased at the time but available now). Digging, I discovered the similar
game `The Adenturer <https://jameschip.itch.io/the-adventurer>`_, which was
interesting but seems structured more as journal prompt and less as solo
gaming experience.

In my searching, I discovered `Shut Up & Sit Down <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyRhIGDUKdIOw07Pd8pHxCw>`_
had put out a few videos on solo gaming:

1.  `The Wild, Affordable World of 1 Player Print'n'Play Games <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNghPlwbYe8>`_,
    which introduced me to `Bargain Basement Bathysphere <https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255360/bargain-basement-bathysphere>`_ (BBB).
    BBB is quick, fun, totally free, and has quite a bit of content. After a
    handful of fun dives, I kind of lost interest in continuing. There's
    a little too much of a push your luck mechanic for my taste and it's
    too light on story for what I want right now.
2.  `The Quiet Year - A Perfect Game for Isolation <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqhE2CmaC_o>`_,
    which just speaks to me on a geometry and cartography level. I haven't
    played it but it sure adds wood to the play solo games fire.

From there, I scoured `/r/soloboardgaming <https://www.reddit.com/r/soloboardgaming/>`_,
and `BoardGameGeek <https://boardgamegeek.com/>`_ in search of something that
would be exactly what I wanted. An honorable mention is due to
`Pocket Dungeon <https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42361/pocket-dungeon>`_,
which is a kind of fun PnP roguelike game.

Somewhere, somehow, I learned that solo roleplaying games are a thing, which
is why `/r/Solo_Roleplaying <https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/>`_
exists. This has turned into quite the rabbit hole and I have subsequently
consumed (and re-consumed) a number of role playing game books figuring out
how I want to approach Solo RP as a concept. Ultimately, I've decided to
develop my own system; it'll be built as a series of game layers based on
the scale of the setting. The goal of the final layer is something
interstellar that scales up and down depending on where the player is at
any time. For now, I'm focused on the basics of character creation, gameplay,
and story building. World building, and galaxy building can come later.

Some of my major influences so far are:

-   `Shadowrun <https://www.shadowruntabletop.com/>`_ - honestly not a huge
    influence on this specific project but it's the RPG that I played
    extensively in my teens and early 20s, so it will always be a seminal
    influence on me as a RPG player. I can't not mention it and I still think
    that 3e is the best edition.

-   `Traveller <https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/us/rpgs/new-traveller.html>`_ -
    I am pretty sure that I want to build up to an interstellar scale and
    Traveller is kind of the gold standard for space operatic RPGs that span
    large swathes of a galaxy. Traveller also introduced me to the idea of a
    lifepath-based character creation system.

    A quick aside is needed for `MegaTraveller 1: The Zhodani Conspiracy <https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/MegaTraveller_1:_The_Zhodani_Conspiracy>`_,
    a computer game that I played as a kid and never got much of anywhere in. I
    wanted to figure out how to make this game get anywhere but I was a small
    child and the idea fell out of my head until after MS-DOS stopped being an
    easy thing to use.

-   `Mythic <http://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic-rpg.html>`_ - here is where
    we start to get into the meat of the solo side of things. I, honestly, had
    never seen something like Mythic before. It's less a system for managing
    characters actions within a planned narrative and more a way of randomly
    generating a universe through an endless series of yes/no questions.

-   `The Burning Wheel <https://www.burningwheel.com/>`_ - I want to play The
    Burning Wheel for real. It looks so awesome. There is a skills and
    progression system that encourages using the rules to progress the game
    but also narrows everything down to success tests (that feel very Shadowrun
    4e). But everything boils down to those success tests and there's a very
    rich in-game/in-character karma system. The character generation is
    lifepath-based and then, the most novel bit of all, there's the
    "Let it Ride" rule.

    "Let it Ride" basically says that the result of a die roll determines
    the nature of reality and must stand. If I fail to pick a lock, that's
    it; the lock cannot be picked, by anyone. If I roll to convince someone
    of something and I succeed; they're convinced. No re-rolling; no trying
    again later; reality is set.

-   `Fiasco <https://bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/>`_ - Fiasco is a
    delightfully simple (from a rules standpoint) game for constructing fun
    shared narratives with a Coen Brothers feel. I've played it in person once
    and had an absolute blast of a time. Fiasco very much takes scene-based
    narrative in games to an extreme. Relationships are established; settings
    are established; MacGuffins are planted; and the narrative flows from
    there. The more I think and focus on my game plans, the more my core
    structures are narrowing to PC+NPC+motives+location as the central game
    Oracle components. I wasn't even thinking about Fiasco until a thought
    caught me and I dug my copy out of the depths of my garage.

-   `MechWarrior <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MechWarrior_(role-playing_game)>`_ - a game
    that sits in a universe that I love, by a company that is dear to my heart,
    but that I've never had the opportunity to play. I cannot speak to the
    modern editions (i.e. BattleTech: A Time of War) but the old ones had a
    few great things going for them; namely being made by FASA, being
    BattleTech, thereby interstellar, and by having a lifepath-based character
    generation system.

-   `UNE <http://conjecturegames.com/une/>`_ - the Universal NPC Emulator (UNE)
    is a tool for generating NPCs out of nothing, including motivations, and
    so on. This will be pretty important as a guide for figuring out how to
    create people for my game and seems like a pretty quick and straightforward
    system.

I'm pulling ideas and influences from elsewhere but those account for a solid
thousand or so pages of role playing game manuals that I've read in the past
month or few. I've finally started putting things to paper and had a false
start of a play session. I'm retooling a little but I'll drop some notes from
the false start soon and then, hopefully, use this space as a dev-journal of
sorts.
