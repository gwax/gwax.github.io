My brother and I drove from San Francisco to Las Vegas yesterday where
we met up with the rest of our immediate family for the whole Christmas
thing. I don't really have an awful lot to say about the whole Christmas
thing that I haven't said a great many times before and, although I
could probably find things to say about Las Vegas, there is very little
to say that capture the sheer je ne sais quoi of this place.

Really, to be entirely honest, this post exists solely so that I can
gloat about the fact that I managed to drive from San Francisco to Las
Vegas on less than one tank of fuel; I really do love my Volkswagen TDi.
