So as to be totally clear, [pmath]27 = 3^3 = 3*3*3[/pmath], which is to
say this is pretty much the threeest birthday that I'm going to have
until either ever or arguably 54 years from now. Three being my favorite
number, presumably, makes today somewhat noteworthy in a numerological
sense. That is all.
