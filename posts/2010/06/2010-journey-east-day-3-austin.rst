Although exceedingly warm by my standards, Austin is not an unpleasant
place. The primary events of the 3rd day of my journey were lunch with
Gautham and Ariel; the acquisition of nearly sufficient wardrobe items
as will serve most of my needs for the summer; a rather substantial nap;
and dinner with Riad, Gautham, Cyrus, and Riad's lady-friend.

Baldr has been having a good time hanging out with Nico and Shockley, as
well as, generally, not being in the car. Baldr mostly sits, stands,
lies down, or naps in the car, which, practically speaking, is not
altogether dissimilar from what he does during the vast majority of
other times.

Also, I finished Moby Dick and it was awesome. Moby Dick is, truly, a
leviathan of literature in every possible sense.

Austin is serving as a nice part-way spot to rest and, if it were the
weekend, it might be pleasant to stay a little longer. In order to cover
distance, rather than wait while people work, Day 4 will, hopefully, see
the Louisiana shore and the city of New Orleans.
