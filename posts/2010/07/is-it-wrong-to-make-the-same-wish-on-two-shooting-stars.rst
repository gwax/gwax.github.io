Is it wrong to make the same wish on two shooting stars?

One of the nice things about Woods Hole is that there are few enough
lights that you can see the stars in the sky. It's really quite pleasant
to be out on a moonless night and see so very many stars scattered
across the skies.

Sometimes, being in San Francisco, I forget how nice it is to go for an
evening walk through empty, dark streets, with trees to the sides and
stars above.

To get back to the titular question, I've been seeing quite a few
shooting stars--I think that I'm up to five since getting here--and I've
always liked the tradition of wishing on shooting stars. Being as I am,
I don't really put much merit in wishing, except insofar as planting
things in one's own subconscious can be beneficial, but I also rather
enjoy harmless, meaningless superstition from time to time. Of course,
when things come down to superstition, etiquette really takes on a
strong role but etiquettes of superstition tend to vary greatly. I find,
that there are relatively few things that I would actually want to wish
for and that number has already been overcome by the number of shooting
stars that I have seen.

Is it poor form to reuse a wish on a new shooting star?
