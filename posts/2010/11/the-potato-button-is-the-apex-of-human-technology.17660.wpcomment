once survival techniques such as cooking for subsistence are obsolete,
humanity will reach a stage of idleness. will we use our time for good?
for art, beauty, friendship? or will we drown in inanity? forever
creating the next "potato button"? or perhaps we'll just be bored and
pick wars with each other? the struggle for survival makes life
interesting--even worth living.
