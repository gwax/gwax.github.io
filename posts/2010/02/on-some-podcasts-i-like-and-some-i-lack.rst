I have recently taken to listening to audio podcasts while at work and I
find it to be a good combination of entertaining and informative.

The set of podcasts that I am currently listening to is:

-  `The Art Of Manliness <http://artofmanliness.podbean.com/feed/>`__
-  `Car Talk <http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=510208>`__
-  `The Dinner Party
   Download <http://www.publicradio.org/columns/dinnerpartydownload/podcast.xml>`__
-  `In The
   Loop <http://minnesota.publicradio.org/tools/podcasts/in_the_loop.xml>`__
-  `Marketplace <http://feeds.americanpublicmedia.org/MarketplacePodcast?format=xml>`__
-  `Marketplace
   Money <http://feeds.americanpublicmedia.org/MarketplaceMoneyPodcast?format=xml>`__
-  `The Moth <http://feeds.themoth.org/themothpodcast?format=xml>`__
-  `News from Lake
   Wobegon <http://americanpublicmedia.publicradio.org/podcasts/xml/prairie_home_companion/news_from_lake_wobegon.xml>`__
-  `Radio Lab <http://feeds.wnyc.org/radiolab?format=xml>`__
-  `Savage Love <http://feeds.thestranger.com/stranger/savage>`__
-  `The Skeptics' Guide to the
   Universe <http://www.theskepticsguide.org/feed/rss.aspx?feed=SGU>`__
-  `The Splendid
   Table <http://americanpublicmedia.publicradio.org/podcasts/xml/splendid_table/kitchen_questions.xml>`__
-  `This American
   Life <http://feeds.thisamericanlife.org/talpodcast?format=xml>`__
-  `This Week in Science <http://feeds.twis.org/twis/science>`__

For the most part, I'm quite pleased by the set of podcasts that I
listen to and a great many of them are either balanced or agenda-free
(e.g. The Splendid Table) but others carry rather strong slants/agendas
(e.g. Skeptics' Guide), which is fine. However, the slants and agendas
that are typified in the podcasts that I listen to are ones that I agree
with and, as such, they don't push me or make me think as hard as I
would like. To that end, I am interested in hunting down some high
quality podcasts that I disagree with.

I am putting the call out to you, Internet, what are some good
conservative, libertarian, military-industrial, etc. podcasts for me to
listen to?
