I keep seeing the same advertisement for the Palm Pre on the sides of
buses; the advertisement says: "Life moves fast. Don't miss a thing."

I understand what they are trying to say and it is a very good tagline
for what they are trying to market but, whenever I see it, I can't help
but think that it speaks to a sad fact of our current culture.

I wish that I could say one thing to everyone that this tagline appeals
to: Not everything matters. Relax.
