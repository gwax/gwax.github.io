I recently got rid of my old cell phone plan in favor of a new T-Mobile
plan with a Sidekick 2. The Sidekick 2 is this fancy little cell
phone/e-mail/IM/web/camera/etc. thing. For the technologically savvy out
there, I've got an SSH client on the thing too. Anyway, part of the
reason that I upgraded my blog from blosxom to wordpress is so that I
could post from my sidekick, and that is just what I am doing right now.
