The ever so wonderful media piracy site suprnova.org has shut down and
now I have to try harder to find torrents. Needless to say, this is
pretty irritating for myself and media download whores worldwide. Of
course, I would never download anything that I don't have legitimate
reasons to own digital copies of as that would violate the copyright
laws of my country of residence and be wrong. That having been said,
there's this neat application `TorrenTopia <http://torrentopia.org/>`__
that is a BitTorrent client that allows you to search for torrent files;
it's pretty slick and now I can get all of my legitimate downloads
easily.

Still, pisses me off that suprnova.org went down. Of course, there's
still some other decent p2p file sharing programs out there and there's
always the option of knowing some guy that has the files you want.

**UPDATE:** TorrenTopia sucks, just go to http://torrentsearch.org/ and
you'll get the search capabilities without the shitty client. Keep using
`BitTornado <http://bittornado.com/>`__; it's better.
