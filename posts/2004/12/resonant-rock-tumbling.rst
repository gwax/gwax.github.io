This morning (~1p) I was awoken by a very distinct, solid hum that
appeared to be coming from nowhere. I sat up to see if I could place the
sound and it got much quieter, almost disappearing. I figured the sound
must have gone away, so I lay back down to go back to sleep and the hum
returned. After a little bit of moving and curiosity, I managed to
determine that the sound reached a maximum right where I lay my head and
was otherwise mostly non-existent, which was very curious and made it
very difficult to track the sound. This led me to believe that there was
some sound nearby hitting a resonant frequency of the region where I
sleep, so I went hunting for the hum, which seemed to be vaguely coming
from upstairs. As soon as I got to my brother Joe's room, the source of
the humming because quite obvious, his new rock tumbler. The rock
tumbler's motor was operating at a frequency which, when placed above
that particular corner of my room, caused a very loud resonance right
where I try to sleep. Having figured out the source and having gotten
about nine hours of sleep anyway, I don't really mind but it was pretty
unpleasant waking up to a really loud hum and wondering if I was going
crazy because it only existed when I tried to lie down.
