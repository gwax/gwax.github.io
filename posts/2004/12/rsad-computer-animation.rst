Following a link from a friend, I ended up watching an animated short
from Ringling School of Art and Design. Looking around a little I was
able to find a whole set of animated shorts in their
`portfolio <http://www.rsad.edu/indexfs.html?fc=openPortfolio>`__ (also
accessible by going to the `RSAD homepage <http://www.rsad.edu/>`__ and
clicking Portfolio). From there if you click on Computer Animation you
will be presented with a bunch of animated shorts.

All of the shorts are artistically and technically very well done. Some
are cute, some are funny, some are cool, some are awesome. Personally,
my favorites are The Pier, The Fall and Eat Your Peas.

Go forth and watch awesome animated shorts.
