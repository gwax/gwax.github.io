I've added a new statistics system to my blog in order to replace the
hit counter that I used to have when I was running blosxom. The package
that I am using under WordPress is DElyMyth's
`Wp-Dstats2 <http://www.delymyth.net/en/index.php?p=1007>`__ because it
seems to be the closest thing to what I want. Wp-Dstats2 has a bunch
more features than I actually want but I guess it will be collecting
some interesting stuff along the way.

The only downside to using a new statistics engine is that I have lost
all of my old information. Oh well, such things happen.
