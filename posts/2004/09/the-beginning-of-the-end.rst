It is now officially the beginning of the end, today was the first day
of the first term of my last year as an undergraduate at MIT. It's kind
of funny; wasn't long ago that I got here and it was even more recent
that they handed us our Brass Rats. It's kind of funny how fast time
flies. At this rate, I'll be getting my Ph.D. before I know what's
happening.
