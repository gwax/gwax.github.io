Now, I know you all have been wondering where I went and when I was
going to return, so I'll tell you. I didn't go anywhere, it's just that
in the confusion of people moving and getting r-type moved from one
place to another, r-type ended up offline for a very long time. As to
when I'm going to return, r-type just came online and it plans to stay
that way.

I'm just as annoyed as you are; there have been plenty of truly amusing
antics that I would love to have made you all aware of but the moments
have passed and you'll just have to wait until something new happens.

Also, flying monkeys.
