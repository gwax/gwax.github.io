I've been on a real movie watching binge this evening. I started with
Transformers: The Movie, moved on to Roujin Z, then Ghost in the Shell,
Metropolis and finally The Magnificent Seven. Whole lot of movie
watching, some of them are pretty good movies though.

Anyway, The Magnificent Seven is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's masterwork
Seven Samurai as a western. They do a very good job of taking the story
and a lot of things from the original and bringing them to the new
style; it's very noticeably the same story. There are, however, a number
of changes that have been made, probably for the slightly different
setting and audience. The last time that I watched The Magnificent Seven
I had not recently seen the original and didn't see the significance of
the changes. Having seen the original in the past few months and
watching the remake now shows me that the differences are really very
significant and as such I can only say that The Magnificent Seven is
pretty good compared. Please remember that I consider Seven Samurai to
be one of the greatest movies ever made.
