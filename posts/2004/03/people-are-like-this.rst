|Sinfest 03/12/04| Sorry, the comic had to be shrunk or it simply would
not fit. Since it is pretty much unreadable, I recommend clicking on it,
reading the comic and then reading this post. The post makes less sense
without the context of the comic

It's actually kind of sad how many people there are that take a position
like the one that Percy is taking in this particular Sinfest comic.
People are almost invariably unable to admit their own weaknesses and
faults, especially to those that are best able to help them (such as
their good friends). I will admit that I have suffered from this fault
just as much as many other people do, and some people will note where it
has gotten me.

I do think that I am getting better about it and I certainly hope that
there is some way that I can convince the the people I like that they
should do the same. I think that everyone can take a good lesson from
AA, even if you don't drink: the first step is to admit you have a
problem. Even if your problem is that you're stuck in a tree like poor
Percy is. If you can't admit to yourself that there is a problem, then
you can't solve it and if you can't admit it to someone else, then you
can't get help.

Maybe I'm going too far, but I think that there are a lot of people in
the world that won't ask their friends for help, even when they need it.
It's a sad world in which friends don't ask friends for help. To that
end, a good friend should pry deep into the psyches of those that he or
she cares about and make sure that there isn't a little cat stuck in a
tree somewhere.
