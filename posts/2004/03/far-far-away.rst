The more time I spend thinking about what I want to do right now, the
more I realize that I want to get away from here, far, far away from
here. By far away, I mean, approximately, the other side of the country
or even another country. I want to pick up and do something different
with my life, even for just a little while.

I'm not terribly sure what the best way to satisfy my desire is but I'm
strongly considering just getting together a little bit of money,
hitchhiking to Hollywood and trying to get into a movie.

These days I've been realizing how tired I am of the whole academia
thing. I had been doing the same thing for so long that by now I have
completely forgotten why I am doing it in the first place. I need a
change of pace and a change of scenery, if even for just a few months.
