I just watched Punch Drunk Love (yeah I know that it's been out for a
while) and I really liked it. I tried watching it once before and didn't
make it very far (this was a while ago) but this time I set out to watch
it clear through and it turns out that it starts to get really
interesting just after I gave up last time. Interesting character that
Barry, a little on the psychotic side but I like him.

Good movie.
