I am quite enamored with living things as an art medium, as is the case
with bonsai, topiary, gardens and `circus
trees <http://www.phancy.com/circus/>`__. As far as the last example is
concerned, color me impressed. Axel Erlandson is my new hero and Gilroy,
CA is now on the list of places that I need to visit at some point in my
life.
