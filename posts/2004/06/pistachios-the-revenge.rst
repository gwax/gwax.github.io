Pistachios are one of nature's trickiest double edged swords. On the one
hand, they are ever so tasty, but on the other hand, they lacerate your
tongue. This isn't any sort of fun laceration that I'm talking about
either, not that there really is such a thing unless you've got
masochistic tendencies. Anyway, the point is, pistachios hurt your
tongue if you eat too many. If I'd known then what I know now, I still
would have eaten all those pistachios because, in a gains and losses
kind of world, pistachios are so totally worth it.
