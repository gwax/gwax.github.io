I am a nerd

I recently gained access to a whole bunch of episodes of various Star
Trek show (TOS, TNG, DS9) and have started watching some of the TOS
episodes. This admission in and of itself lays a path out for me, but
I've been finding a whole lot of scientific anomalies in what's going
on. The errors that I'm finding are not the "you can't travel faster
than light" kind, or super fantastic astrophysics errors, but the simple
science kinds, like how NaCl acts chemically. On one hand, I feel good
because I know all this science and am a little disappointed that the
errors exist in Star Trek, and, on the other hand, I feel like a
complete nerd for noticing things like this.

I guess that it's a good thing that I don't really mind being a nerd
sometimes.
