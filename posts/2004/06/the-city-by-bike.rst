Yesterday, I discovered, by personal experience, that it takes about an
hour and a half to bike into Boston or Cambridge from home. This is
useful information for me to have, because now I know that I can get
pretty much anywhere that I might want to go from Concord by bicycle.
It's quite a workout but it feels really good and leaves me at places
that I want to be.
