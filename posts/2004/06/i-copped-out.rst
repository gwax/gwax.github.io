My `www page <http://www.gwax.com/>`__ is back up now. I was planning on
redoing the entire thing and coming up with a new style and being fancy
like, but when I sat down to actually do it, I was very quick to change
my mind. After about a half hour or so of messing with CSS and layout,
with nothing that looked better than my old site, I looked through my CD
backups for an old copy of my webpage. The newest copy that I could find
was really old, notably from last summer. Keeping the layout from the
old version, I went ahead with updating and replacing the content with
new stuff.

All in all, I copped out on completely remaking my website and just
revised the content. That having been said, I do have a decent www page
again and the layout and style are still pretty darned slick, if you ask
me.
