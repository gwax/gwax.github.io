I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 last night, if you haven't heard of it, crawl out
of that cave you've been living in. It sure is something. I don't
particularly want to review the movie or give my opinion on the topics
it addresses because I won't do justice to my own beliefs, but I
recommend that people go see it and form their own opinions.
