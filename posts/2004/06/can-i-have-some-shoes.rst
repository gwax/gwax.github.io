Anyone that's played much C&C: Generals knows how very amusing it is
when the GLA workers say "Can I have some shoes?" and in the game's
expansion, Zero Hour, you can actually get the shoes upgrade, to which
they respond, "Thank you for the shoes." Unfortunately, in the real
world, you can't just click a button and give all of the poor people in
Afghanistan shoes, which many of them need, especially children. As an
attempt to rectify this problem, some kind hearted members of the US Air
Force have started what they call `Operation Shoe
Fly <http://www.sgthook.com/blog/oldblog/000625.php>`__. Quoth Sgt.
Hook:

   Just about every flight engineer and crew chief has noticed over the
   course of flying across this place called Afghanistan these past
   months that a large percentage of the children have no shoes to wear
   and of course, almost all of the girls are shoeless.

   So my esteemed friends of the blogosphere, in the spirit of `Chief
   Wiggles <http://chiefwiggles.com/>`__ and minding the words of the
   infamous Steve Miller Band, I announce the beginning of *Operation
   Shoe Fly* in an effort to *shoe the children, with no shoes on their
   feet.* If you can collect the shoes, used or new, boys' and girls'
   (age 14 and under), and send them to me, my crewdogs and I will fly
   them out to the Afghani kids who so desperately need them.

   Please send your shoes to:

   *Operation Shoe Fly
   B Co, 214th Aviation Regiment
   Bagram, Afghanistan
   APO AE 09354-9998*

   Another way to help is of course by getting the word out on
   *Operation Shoe Fly*. I would be most appreciative for any and all
   help in spreading the word on our endeavor, including anyone who
   might be willing to make a button or banner to post around the
   blogosphere. Thanks.

   In addition to protecting the feet of these young innocent children,
   we might even win some hearts and minds among their parents and who
   knows where the shoes might take these kids. This place is on the
   dawn of a future, determining how bright it will be rests on the
   shoulders of these kids with no shoes on their feet. What say you?
   *Sgt Hook out.*
