Last night I went and saw Anchorman with some friends and it was
absolutely spectacular. One of the best comedies that I have seen in a
while. The humor skirted the line of over-the-top a great deal but, in
my opinion, didn't spend too much time beyond it.

This is one of the best comedies that I have seen in a while, and I
*highly* recommend it.
