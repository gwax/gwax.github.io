KMFDM is doing a 20th anniversary tour this year and they're going to be
at the Middle East in Cambridge, MA on November 1\ :sup:`st`. The Middle
East is just a few blocks up Mass Ave. from MIT. KMFDM is my favorite
band, I have not yet seen them in concert and they are going to be in my
city in just a few months. I'm going to have to see if I can find anyone
else to go with me and make it to the concert.
