One word that I've never picked up from l33tspeak is the word ph34r
(fear). I ought to start using ph34r more often; chances are pretty good
that I won't, but I still like the idea a bunch. I also need to work on
getting the phrase "raging it" better entrenched into the common lingo
amongst my friends.

Ah slang, I love you so.
