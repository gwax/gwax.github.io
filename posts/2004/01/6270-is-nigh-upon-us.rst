6.270 qualifiers and seeding rounds are today and impound is Wednesday.
Our robot is very much not ready to actually compete but we only need to
score a few points in order to qualify and be allowed in the actual
competition. I'm confident that we can score enough points to qualify,
though we will likely seed poorly (not that it really matters). After
that's out of the way, it should probably take us a few an hour or so of
dedicated work to get the robot competition ready (by which I mean
capable of winning). We should be plenty ready in time for impound.

All in all, despite the fact that both Muth and I have pretty much taken
IAP off, I am still confident that we've got this thing figured out.
More 6.270 news when we're competition ready.
