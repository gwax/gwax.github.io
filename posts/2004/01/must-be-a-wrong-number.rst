When you're asleep or half-asleep, your mind doesn't quite work right.
For instance, I had my alarm clock set for 2p today and when it went
off, I decided to answer it. By answer, I mean grabbing my alarm clock,
pressing snooze, holding it to my ear and saying "Hello". It must have
been a wrong number because I think they hung up on me. I kept receiving
calls on my alarm clock once every nine minutes until I figured out what
was going on.
