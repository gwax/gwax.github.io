Right now there's this Mystery Hunt thing going on in my dorm and other
MIT related places. Basically, it's this huge puzzle contest of sorts.
This year, once again, I have decided not to take a hugely active role
in the matter and have just taken a consulting sort of approach to the
whole thing. As it stands, I have consulted on two problems both of
which have been solved whilst I was helping. The first one was something
involving some organic molecules and whatnot; other people did the grunt
work and I helped with some of the end bits and getting the solution.
The second one was this really neat symmetry/crystallography one which I
got involved with when someone said, "Hey George, we have a problem that
we think is crystallography, help us." Now, on this puzzle, I was there
pretty much from start to finish (minus sleep and some other things) and
I played a pretty pivotal role in solving all parts of it. After all, I
do know my crystallography. Incidentally, we were the first team to
solve the symmetry/crystallography puzzle and the organizers expect that
we may be the only team that will solve it.

w00t!
