It's 8a now; I woke up at 4a, watched Back to The Future with some of my
peeps and I'm about to go back to sleep. There, that's the setting for
you.

Before going back to sleep, I decided to glance at the various blogs of
my various friends (ha ha, too much use of the word various). In looking
at `Amrys' blog <http://amrys.devl.org/blog/>`__. Specifically noting
the new (as of now) entry, "`The quotable
Rodin. <http://amrys.devl.org/blog/archives/000138.html>`__" I followed
the various links and the "`'70s
baby <http://www.101-baby-stuff.com/top-100-baby-names-1970s.htm>`__"
link led to a list of the top 100 baby names of the 1970s. That's the
precursory set up for you.

I'm a fan of names; they're very interesting. In fact I've recently had
a bit of a fascination with names (both given and of the nickname
variety), signatures and other things that manage to encapsulate the
essence of a person (but that's just me waxing philosophical). Anyway,
I'm looking through the list of names and I'm not terribly amused so I
go back to the `page above
it <http://www.101-baby-stuff.com/babys-names.htm>`__, which has
listings of the top ten names of various time periods. At this point, my
curiosity is starting to wane and I decide to find out what the
72\ :sup:`nd` boy's `name of
1990 <http://www.101-baby-stuff.com/top-100-baby-names-1990s.htm>`__ is
and it turns out to be Devin (Shannon for girls), which is not too
thrilling. It strikes my fancy that I ought to find my name (George) on
one of these lists and see where it stands; my name isn't on the 1990
list, so I start moving backwards in time (kind of like the movie I just
watched, wee!). My name does show up, however, on the `1980s
list <http://www.101-baby-stuff.com/top-100-baby-names-1980s.htm>`__
(mind you, I was born in the 80s). The interesting bit is not that
George shows up in the '80s list, but rather that it shows up in
position 72 on the list (Stacy for girls). Fancy that little
coincidence, position 72 right after I wanted to see who was 72 in the
'90s.

As a side note, 72 is 2 to the 3 times 3 to the 2. I like 3.
