Yesterday I went to PetCo and bought a whole bunch of little fish (~20)
and gave them to Mister Tickles. Needless to say, amusement followed as
Tickles made a task of hunting and consuming all of the feeder fish.

I am strongly considering getting another fish tank and breeding guppies
or some other small fish so that I can keep Tickles in live food.
