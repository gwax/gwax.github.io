My friend Riad does not have a blog because he thinks that they are
lame. The only thing that I can infer from such a statement is that he
does not believe one should document their life on the internet. That
having been said, he does keep a `bunch of
photos <http://images.jfet.org/>`__ online that fairly well follow the
activities of his life. Please keep in mind that even though it
chronicles his life, it is `not a
blog <http://images.jfet.org/00_THIS_IS_NOT_A_BLOG>`__. Thank you, that
is all.
