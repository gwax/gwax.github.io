So, I was bored and looking for information on the new Xbox Ninja Gaiden
game that's coming out next month and I decided to see what
`Gamespot <http://www.gamespot.com/>`__'s top games are so I pulled up
their search thing and searched for all games with ratings between 10
and 10. And there, lo and behold, was Soul Calibur, one of only 4 games
to ever get a rating of 10.0 on Gamespot. Yeah, I know that I'm a
colossal dork, but in my defense, I really like Soul Calibur.
