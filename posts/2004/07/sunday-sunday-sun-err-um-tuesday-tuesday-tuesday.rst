Last night I went to my first demolition derby and it was totally sweet.
So much car smashing; so much goodness; so much fun. The derby was in
the context of the Barnstable County Fair, which I went to with a few
friends last evening. Also, I got me a neat blue feed cap referencing
the demolition derby.

I'll tell you one thing though, watching a demolition derby makes me
wish that I could smash cars.
