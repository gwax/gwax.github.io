I have run into a hideously annoying problem at work, whereby Apache
seems to be returning default index pages as type application/x-trash to
Firefox, lynx and Safari. In trying to solve this problem, I was
reminded by google that my friend hippo `had the same
problem <http://fluxion.mit.edu/blog/index.cgi/2003/12/24#apache-firebird-bug>`__
(*hippo, your permalinks are broken*). I have spent a bunch of time
trying to fix this damned problem and I'm really getting kind of sick of
it. I'd like to fix it, but teh intzorweb is not much help so I think
that I'll keep ignoring it for a while longer.

*UPDATE:* hippo has fixed his permalinks
