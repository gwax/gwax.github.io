As a follow-up to my
`tirade <http://blog.gwax.com/archives/2004/05/20/fing-javascript-conventions/>`__
about brace ('{' and '}') conventions in Javascript, I would like to
bring up that PHP uses the same conventions. Why can't they let me
vertically line up my braces? This really irritates me a whole heck of a
lot.

*UPDATE:* As the comment points out, I spoke too soon. On one hand, I am
retarded, on the other, I am very pleased. I guess that I have been
misled by the plethora of PHP examples that use the other brace style.
Although I would have sworn that I had tried the other style and failed,
I would have been wrong. Please excuse my foolish slurs.
