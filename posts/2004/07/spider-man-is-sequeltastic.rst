I saw Spider-man 2 today and I have two adjectives that I would like to
use in describing it: fun, crappy.

One thing that I kept thinking about was how totally awesome it would be
too have 4 gigantic robotic arms that half have a mind of their own. The
movie was pretty much worth seeing entirely for Doc Ock. I really ought
to go about inventing cybertechnology (/me is a Shadowrun dork).

Also, there was a whole lot of emotional, chick flick stuff in the
movie. As much of a shame I will be to my gender, I'm going to say that
I don't usually mind that emotional, chick flick stuff too much, but in
the case of Spider-man 2, it was not only overdone, but rather poorly
done as well.
