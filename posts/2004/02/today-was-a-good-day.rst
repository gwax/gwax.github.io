In spite of continued exile, today (Thursday) was a good day in the
world of George. The quality of the day was also high in spite of having
classes from 8:30a-5p (w/30 minutes off). Here is why today P0wnz3d:

-  Last class day of my week.
-  Caught half of the webcomics lecture (pretty good).
-  Saw Bat Boy (really, really good).
-  Hung out with a bunch of my friends (sw00t!).
-  Played a bunch of Disc Golf starting at midnight (sw00t as well).
