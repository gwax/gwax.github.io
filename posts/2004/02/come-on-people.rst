Ok, I admit that I was skeptical about this whole blog thing at first,
but I'm darned well giving it the attention that it deserves. Now some
of you people out there (not all) are only doing a half-assed job of
blogging.

If you don't have a blog, that's your choice; publishing your ideas and
life on the web is not for everyone, but if you're going to do it, do it
right. You don't have to post five times a day or anything like that,
but once every week or two is not sufficient and those of you doing the
once every two to four weeks thing really have to get your act together.

Come on, some of us are relying on you here.
