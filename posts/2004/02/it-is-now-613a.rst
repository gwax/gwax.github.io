You might be asking yourself why I'm awake at this hideous time of day;
heck, I might be asking myself the very same question. Unfortunately, I
know what the answer to the question is: class. I have an 8:30a class on
Tuesdays and Thursdays this term. The problem of course is that I have
to go to sleep at like 10:00p on Mondays and Wednesdays but the upside
is that I don't have anything on Friday or in the morning on Monday and
Wednesday.

I guess the truth of the matter is that it's really early, I don't have
anything to say and I don't want to follow the previous entry with a
long pause because, despite the ironic humor, I don't want to be that
guy.
