So, we just watched Encino Man in Happiness (433) and I'm not really
sure how to put it. Most people would probably call it a bad movie,
maybe a very bad movie, but me, I was amused. Let's see if the cast
gives you any idea of the quality of the film: Pauly Shore, Brendan
Frasier and that guy that plays Sam in the Lord of the Rings.

**Synopsis:** (spoiler warning) Guy likes girl. Girl doesn't like guy.
Guy digs up caveman. Hilarity ensues. Guy gets girl.

Hey, if it's got Pauly Shore, then it's got to be good right? I mean,
look at such unforgettable classics as Bio-Dome, Jury Duty or In the
Army Now.
