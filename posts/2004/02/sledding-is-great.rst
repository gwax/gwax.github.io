Hippo, Max, Riad and I went sledding this evening and it was totally
awesome. Yesterday, it snowed a bunch and then it rained a bit but then
it got colder again today. The final result of all of these weather
shenanigans was a thin layer of snow that was coated by a thicker layer
of ice-like crust and then there were many areas consisting entirely of
ice. Suffice it to say that there was quite a lot of fast sledding and a
lot of bumps that will likely be bruises tomorrow, but hey, it builds
character and it was totally worth it.
