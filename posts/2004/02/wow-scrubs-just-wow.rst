I just finished watching the most recent episode of Scrubs (episode 314)
and I've got to say that it's really something, something powerful. As
minutes pass and I have a chance to think about the episode, elements of
the episode are falling into place in my mind. The ending was superb and
the foreshadowing and character development were marvelous. I would not
expect this much from a show in its third season. This was probably one
of the best episodes of Scrubs that I've seen.
