There are a lot of things that people talk about as being particularly
important character traits; things like honor, dignity, confidence,
skill, and plenty of others. I've been doing a lot of thinking of late
and I have to say that honor has got to be the most important character
trait of all.

If you have your honor then you have everything. If you do not have your
honor then you have nothing.
