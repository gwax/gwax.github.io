I have done one of those coming of age things, but it wasn't one of
those great movie-style adventures, I just waited for a while.
Incidentally, the age of which I have come is 21 so that puts an end to
underage drinking for me and rings in an era of not breaking the law. I
guess that this means the government trusts me more now than it used to.
