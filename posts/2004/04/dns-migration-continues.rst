Having successfully tested the new DNS server that I'm using (now on
r-type) and had some success (http://www.gwax.org/), I am migrating the
rest of my domains over (gwax.com and gwax.net). The initial plan is
just to have www.\* point to my blog until I decide what to do next.

Hopefully, I'll get this whole issue resolved pretty soon. I don't
really know what I'll do about the lost content on ozone-beast but maybe
I can find a way to save it; we'll see. While I'm fooling with server
stuff I might consider setting up a mail server (or I might not).
