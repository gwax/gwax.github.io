`hippo <http://fluxion.mit.edu/blog/>`__ recently made me aware of a
little Mozilla Firefox extension known as `Mozilla
Firesomething <http://www.cosmicat.com/software/firesomething/>`__.
Firesomething rebrands your Mozilla Firefox as something else, either
randomly constructed or user specified. Because I think that it's more
amusing, I am using the randomly constructed option which lets you
specify different component strings that is builds your brand out of.
During my playing with Firesomthing I happened to find myself running
Mozilla Taconarwhal and was immensely pleased (I am really quite partial
to tacos and narwhals are totally sweet). Someday I expect that I will
run into the legendary Tacosquid; but I'll leave that story another
time.

Just as a little side plug, `Mozilla
Firefox <http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/>`__ is, in my opinion,
the best browser out there and I highly recommend that you give it a try
if you haven't before.
