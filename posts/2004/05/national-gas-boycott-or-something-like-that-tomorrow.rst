This recently came in through AIM channels:

   May 19th is national gas boycott day. With gas prices on the rise,
   something must be done to send a message to the gas companies. If no
   one in America buys gas on the 19th the gas companies will lose an
   estimated $45 MILLION dollars! If you're not happy with paying over
   $2.00/gallon please do not buy gas on May 19th. Please re-post this
   so that it will be able to reach as many people across the country as
   possible.

I guess that means don't buy gas tomorrow. A little late in tossing the
post out what with the boycott tomorrow. Mind you, I haven't verified
the statistics so don't yell at me if they're wrong and if it matters to
you, check them yourself. I don't really know if it'll do anything but
we can all go one day without purchasing gas, so why not?
