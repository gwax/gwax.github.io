I came across this nifty post-apocalyptic, sci-fi radio show on the
internet called `Tales From The Afternow <http://theafternow.com>`__.
It's a free download, but, if you want, you can get them all via `bit
torrent <http://torrent.gwax.com:6969/>`__ as well. It's kind of like
Mad Max meets Shadowrun meets Neuromancer meets etc. but it's all audio
like one of those old fashioned radio fictions. It's pretty neat and I
recommend giving it a listen to, even if you decide against it after the
first one.
