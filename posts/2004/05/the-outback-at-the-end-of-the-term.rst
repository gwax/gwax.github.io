We (my friends and I) have this great tradition of going to The Outback
Steakhouse at the end of every term and it's a nice tradition because
the food is good and the company is better. I don't have very many more
comments on the matter except in so far as to say that it never fails,
in going to restaurants with a bunch of friends, that we always fail to
have enough money to pay the bill and I have to chip in extra. This time
I paid at least $10 more than I owed; what used to be a minor hassle has
turned into something that really irritates me. Max had the bright idea
of having someone play the role of bill dictator (sort of a Stalin for
the dining group's Russia) and I am inclined to suspect that in so doing
we would get the money together faster and I wouldn't have to shell out
so much extra. Allow me to make the point that money is dirty and that
it, alone, can cause me to become irritated with a group of my friends
just points to its evil. My irritation passes quickly and this is mainly
just a rant about how that pisses me off and I am going to look for ways
of preventing it from happening in the future.

Irritation aside, man oh man, did I overeat. My insides are in a
horrible state of feeling bad and spectacular all at the same time. I'm
sure plenty other people understand what it's like to grossly overeat;
that's what I did, but I'd do it all again if given the choice (and I
will at the end of next term).
