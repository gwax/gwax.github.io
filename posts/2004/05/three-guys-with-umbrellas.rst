Every so often I have a brilliant idea for something that would work
well in a play and decide that I should write one. So far as yet I have
written no plays, however I just had another great idea for something to
put into a play. My idea is a scene with three guys that have umbrellas.
Now, I know what you're thinking and it's probably not what I'm thinking
but that's because you think it's a dumb idea and I think that it's a
brilliant idea. Just you wait, when I write a play the scene with three
guys that have umbrellas is going to move you like you have never
imagined possible. By the way, I'm writing a play (I don't give this
pipe dream more than a day or so).
