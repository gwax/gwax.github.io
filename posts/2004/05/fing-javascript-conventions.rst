F***ing Javascript Conventions
==============================

I just changed things around a little on my blog thing so that when you
click on a comments link it will spawn a little comments window (if you
have javascript, otherwise it will behave as normal) so that you can
look at comments aside from the blog itself. The script is simple; it
works; it does what I want.

There is, however, one problem. The conventions (and possibly the
specifications) of javascript are such that when defining a new function
you have to put the opening brace ('{') on the same line as the function
declaration. Placing the brace on the same line as the function
declaration is something that I absolutely loathe; I want my opening
brace ('{') to line up vertically with my closing brace ('}'). If other
people want to put the opening brace on the line with the function call
that is their business (and they are hideous people for it because it
makes their code less readable) but I am not going to force them to do
it my way and as such they should not force me to take up their
abomination of a syntax. I hate it so much that I put the whole function
on one line (good thing it was a simple function).

There, that's my angry tirade against javascript. I seem to remember
discovering this atrocity and being equally disgusted at some time in
the past too. Oh, and don't even get me started with people that don't
know how to indent. I'm going to stop before I double the length of my
blog complaining about coding styles that I hate. Also, I know that my
code isn't perfect either, but I like to think that it's pretty easy to
follow if you know what you're doing.
