I got myself a job for the summer working on a big web development thing
at the MBL in Woods Hole, MA. The project I'm working on involves the
development of a huge information system that serves information about
various organisms (theoretically all of them eventually). My involvement
is two-fold: phase one is to hack an information exchange protocol into
the existing system (which is a huge mess that has been hacked together
over the past few years), phase two is to work with a few other people
(one or two I think) to completely rebuild the whole system in a modular
and clean matter. It looks like it will be a pretty interesting project
and it will give me something to do with my time (and some money too).
