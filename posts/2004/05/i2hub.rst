I just discovered something called `i2hub <http://www.i2hub.com>`__,
which revolutionizes p2p file sharing. Actually, it doesn't really
revolutionize much of anything; it's just a new direct connect hub, but
it's a very good one. The i2hub direct conect hub is a hub that allows
connections only from people with internet2 connections. Internet2 is a
high speed, secondary internet backbone that connects a large number of
colleges and a few other places. So, for the most part, if your college
has internet2 access, you can get on i2hub and trade files at high
speeds with college students from around the US. I am so glad that I
have somewhere I can trade files over synchronous high speed connections
now.
