It's finally happened, I'm starting to give a damn about politics (guess
it had to happen sometime). You might notice that I've added a few more
blogs to my links on the left (that's where I turn for my body politic
and I will probably add more as I start reading them). I try to get a
decent spattering of different political points of view so as to be able
to make my own opinions.

In case anyone cares, here's my take on various political issues right
now: We're wasting tons of money on a war that we shouldn't be fighting.
We're bullying the rest of the world. We're ignoring most of the
problems that exist in our own country. We're returning capitalism to
the hell that it was more than a century ago. Our education system is
going down the tubes. The average American cares more about pop culture
than his or her own well being. (Needless to say, these are all bad
things in my opinion).

That should serve as decent reference for anyone that wants to know my
views. Oh, and I don't like to associate myself with any party because I
believe that giving a name to my belief system gives the name power at
the expense of my actual beliefs (why can't democrats and republicans do
what they believe in and not simply follow the party line?).
