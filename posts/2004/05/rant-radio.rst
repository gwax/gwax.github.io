As of late, I have taken to listening to `Rant
Radio <http://www.rantradio.com/>`__'s talk radio shoutcast stream.
Their modus operandi appears to be freedom of information, which is an
issue close to my heart. This is just a plug, but I encourage you to
take a look (or listen rather).

If you don't want to bother with their website, you can just tune in
[`64k <http://www.rantradio.com/rr-talk64.pls>`__\ \|\ `24k <http://www.rantradio.com/rr-talk24.pls>`__].
