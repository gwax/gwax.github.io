I took me some GREs today; they weren't too bad, but they were pretty
annoying. It took all this time and stuff. The positive aspects of
taking the GRE today is that I can go in and talk to my advisor and see
if he thinks my scores are good enough to apply to grad schools or if I
should go take something again; I really don't want to take them again,
it's expensive and annoying. The neat part about the new computer based
testing is that they give you results for Verbal and Quantitative as
soon as you finish. Not going to post my scores because this isn't high
school anymore but I will say that I was pleased with my Quantitative
score and have mixed feelings about my Verbal score.

GRE be done (as long as my advisor agrees). George out.
