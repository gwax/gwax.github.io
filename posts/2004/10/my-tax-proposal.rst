I've been reading some of Milton Friedman's Capitalism And Freedom and,
although I disagree with a lot of what he says, he does have a few good
points. In reading some of his suggestions for a good system of
taxation, I have gotten a few ideas and come up with a system of
taxation that I like:

::

      T=(I-C1)*C2

It's a very simple system, (T) is how much money you have to pay in
taxes annually, (I) is your annual income, C1 and C2 are constants to be
determined by someone more understanding of economics than myself. In
essence, you can earn up to C1 without being taxed and then anything
beyond that is taxed at rate C2. Key issues with this system are that is
must be taken as it is exactly and there must be no exceptions made; it
does not matter where your income derives from, how many children you
have or anything else, just your annual income.

One could also consider a different approach to the under C1 realm and
use a negative tax scheme where individuals are paid a fraction of the
amount they need to reach C1. For example, take C1 to be $50,000 and C2
to be 50%: individuals making more than $50,000 are taxed half of what
they make beyond $50,000 and individuals making less than $50,000 are
given half of the difference between their income and $50,000.

I would say that the second interpretation is a more "liberal" or
"socialist" approach and can be taken or left based on that fact alone
but that the first interpretation would make for a very good tax scheme
that would be well liked by quite a few people. Personally, I'd like a
C1 of $200,000 and a C2 of 50% but that's just me.
