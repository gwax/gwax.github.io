I've been reading some of Milton Friedman's Capitalism And Freedom and,
although I disagree with a lot of what he says, he does have a few good
points. In reading some of his suggestions for a good system of
taxation, I have gotten a few ideas and come up with a system of
taxation that I like:

.. math::

      T = (I - C_{1}) * C_{2}

It's a very simple system, :math:`T` is how much money you have to pay in
taxes annually, :math:`I` is your annual income, :math:`C_{1}` and :math:`C_{2}` are constants to be
determined by someone more understanding of economics than myself. In
essence, you can earn up to :math:`C_{1}` without being taxed and then anything
beyond that is taxed at rate :math:`C_{2}`. Key issues with this system are that is
must be taken as it is exactly and there must be no exceptions made; it
does not matter where your income derives from, how many children you
have or anything else, just your annual income.

One could also consider a different approach to the under :math:`C_{1}` realm and
use a negative tax scheme where individuals are paid a fraction of the
amount they need to reach :math:`C_{1}`. For example, take :math:`C_{1}` to be $50,000 and :math:`C_{2}`
to be 50%: individuals making more than $50,000 are taxed half of what
they make beyond $50,000 and individuals making less than $50,000 are
given half of the difference between their income and $50,000.

I would say that the second interpretation is a more "liberal" or
"socialist" approach and can be taken or left based on that fact alone
but that the first interpretation would make for a very good tax scheme
that would be well liked by quite a few people. Personally, I'd like a
:math:`C_{1}` of $200,000 and a :math:`C_{2}` of 50% but that's just me.
