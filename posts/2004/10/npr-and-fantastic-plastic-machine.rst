As a follow up to a previous entry `NPR and The Flaming
Lips <http://blog.gwax.com/2004/05/20/npr-and-the-flaming-lips/>`__,
today I heard a portion of a Fantastic Plastic Machine song during one
of the short interludes on NPR. Once again, I am thoroughly pleased by
NPR's ecclectic musical tastes. In case it varies from NPR station to
NPR station, I am refering to WBUR 90.9FM, broadcast out of Boston
University in Massachusetts.
