I just saw I ♥ Huckabees and it was a very strange trip through
existential oddity. It was humorous at times, odd at others and made you
really think about some things at other moments. This movie struck an
interesting chord with me; I'm not sure what or where that chord is, but
I can sure feel it vibrating around in me somewhere. I'll have to watch
this movie again and I highly recommend that other people go see it for
the first time.

Also, I would love to be an existential detective, though I'm not sure
that I understand things enough just yet.
