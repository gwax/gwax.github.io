Just so that we're clear, I do know what topoisomerase does; it relieves
strain in DNA helices by breaking apart one of the helices, unwinding
the other helix a bit and then rebonding the broken helix. Also, I would
like to point out that topoisomerase has a really awesome name. I think
that it would be funny to hear some guy with a deep voice and a thick
Japanese accent say topoisomerase.
