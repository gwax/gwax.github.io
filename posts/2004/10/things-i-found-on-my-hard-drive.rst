I was rooting around my hard drives looking for amusing things to play
with and I came across a couple of things I wrote in the past. One night
I was driving around at 3 AM and then wrote me up a short little thing
that I called `At 3 AM <link://slug/at3am>`__.
Another one I found was something that I wrote about having a `Bad
Day <link://slug/badday>`__ where one or two bad
things happened to me and then I exaggerated a bunch of other stuff on
top of it. The third, and last, thing that I found was something that I
started writing which was meant to be an experiment in writing with a
lot of side phrases in
`Parentheses <link://slug/parentheses>`__.

I make no assertions about the quality of these compositions, but the
first two are kind of fun and the third is kind of different. So yeah,
stuff I wrote; enjoy.
