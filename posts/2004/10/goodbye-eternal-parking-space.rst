For those that have known the eternal parking space in front of Random
Hall, take a moment to acknowledge its passing. Recently (within the
past week) Cambridge upgraded many of the parking meters in the city
from the old, insert quarter turn knob and hand moves type, to a newer,
insert quarter and digital display counts up type. For those that do not
know the eternal parking space, there was a parking meter in front of
Random Hall which was broken such that it always registered about 3
minutes and no car there parked would be ticketed. This parking meter
was broken before I arrived as a freshman and Riad claims that it had
been broken for a long time before then. I guess that this marks the end
of an era; goodbye eternal parking space.
