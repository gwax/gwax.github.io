MY ASS!

I just had my second exam in Freshman/Senior Bio. today and I am
strongly inclined to disagree with the statements earlier this term that
biology classes have moved past memorization to a more scientific
something or other. If it's moved on past memorization then why do I
need to know what topoisomerase does? Ugh, sometimes I start to think
that I'm liking Bio and then they go and pull this crap.
