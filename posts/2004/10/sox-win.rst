Oh man, the Red Sox won the ALCS Pennant and are going to the World
Series. I really hope that the Red Sox win because it will be totally
sweet. Also, if the Red Sox do win, there will probably be some pretty
crazy rioting in Boston. Myself, I'm kind of mixed on the issue of
rioting but, since I've never done so, I think it might be a fun thing
to do at least once. This, of course, means that if the Sox win I am
going to go out rioting. Also, Leslie wants to go rioting too so I think
that we'll make a team effort out of the thing. As far as rioting goes,
I really have only one goal: to be involved in the flipping of a car.
I've never flipped a car and I think that it would be a fun thing to do
at least once in my life.
