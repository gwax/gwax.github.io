Because I see so many other people commenting on this election politics
things I want to weigh in with my view on the matter. This "great
divide" in our country is between a whole bunch of people that are all
exactly alike; the so-called-liberals are acting out in exactly the
manner that they always criticize the so-called-conservatives for. Both
parties are fighting for the same socio-economic system and they only
differ on the specific moral issues that they would like to fight over.
It's a one party system and one of your candidates won; quit your
bitching about pathetic little "issues" and start paying attention to
what's actually wrong with our culture.
