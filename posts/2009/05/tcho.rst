A while back, I was introduced by a
`boingboing <http://boingboing.net/>`__ video series
(`1 <http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/07/11/tcho-part-1-chocolat.html>`__,
`2 <http://tv.boingboing.net/2008/07/22/tcho-chocolate-part.html>`__,
`3 <http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/08/bbtv-tcho-chocolate-1.html>`__)
to the chocolate manufacturer `TCHO <http://tcho.com/>`__. Sometime
after watching the video series, my friend Josh showed up to one of our
poker nights with a block of TCHO chocolate. That, beta bar that Josh
brought was fantastic and TCHO has further perfected their recipes in
the interim. Having recently discovered that TCHO has opened a retail
store at Pier 17 on the Embarcadero, which is quite close to where I
work, I decided to pop over and grab some chocolate on my lunch break. I
grabbed a `TCHO-A-DAY
60-pack <http://www.tcho.com/store/bars/tcho-a-day-60.html>`__ and have
thus far tried the "Citrus" and "Chocolatey" flavors, which were
excellent. This may well be the best chocolate that I have ever had.

If you would like a little bit of truly wonderful decadence in your
life, I highly recommend getting yourself some TCHO chocolate. The
engineering, quality and flavor to this chocolate is truly top-grade.
