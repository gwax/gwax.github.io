I just read two fantastic pieces from the `Free Software
Foundation <http://www.fsf.org/>`__. The first, a guest post on
`TorrentFreak <http://torrentfreak.com/>`__, addresses the question of
`Why the FSF cares about RIAA
lawsuits <http://torrentfreak.com/the-war-on-sharing-why-the-fsf-cares-about-riaa-lawsuits-090513/>`__
and is a very insightful view into the dangers involved in the direction
that copyright, patent and trademark laws seem to be headed. The second
article, which was linked from the first, is an `article by Richard M.
Stallman on the term "intellectual
property" <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html>`__, and the
dangers of conflating copyrights, patents, trademarks and physical
property. I find the article to be both interesting and insightful to a
sufficient extent that I have decided to strike the term "intellectual
property" from my lexicon. Henceforth, I will discuss such matters in
the frame of what they are, not the frame that major rights holding
organizations would like to phrase them in.

I feel that these articles are both extremely well written and make
strong points on the nature of copyrights/patents/trademarks. I also
feel that these articles give me a better vantage point from which to
discuss the juxtaposition of copyrights and physical property rights.
There are certainly some sharp people, doing some very important things
at the FSF.
