I have finally gotten around to updating my blog to the latest version
of Wordpress (I used to be horribly behind). As you may have noticed, I
am back at the default theme; I will likely do something about this
eventually; you may have to bear with me until then, if you haven't
already left due to my extended silence.

Speaking of that whole silence thing; I'm hoping to return to posting
more often than I may have in the past (not that I haven't said that
before). For right now, I'm focusing on being in flux and getting things
back to where they were; with luck it'll just involve writing some new
css to go with the default theme. To get those square boxes, borders and
the like back; perhaps fit to width as well.

Anyway, just wanted to break silence and let you guys know that that's
my intent for future times.
