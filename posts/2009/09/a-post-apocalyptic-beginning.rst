I just came up with what I think is a good first line for a book and a
not quite so good second line:

"Our parents used to ask each other if they remember where they were
when a man first walked on the moon or when the Berlin Wall fell; we
used to ask each other where we were when the World Trade Center fell;
now, if we can find anyone to ask, we ask where we were when the world
ended."

"I remember where I was when the world ended; I was in a McDonald's, and
I didn't even like McDonald's."
