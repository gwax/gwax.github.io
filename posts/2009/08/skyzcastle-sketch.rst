machines|\ [/caption] First off, I have to admit that I don't know why I
decided to give this file a filename of "SkyzCastle" except that it must
have seemed appropriate at the time that I made it. I'm about a month
behind on posting images so I really can't say what my motivations were
at the time. This sketch is, I would say, ok at best, but I am trying to
adopt a policy of posting my art here. In case it isn't clear, this is a
castle on a mountain top that is under siege/assault from balloons and
ornithopters.
