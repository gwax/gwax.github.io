I recently considered the naming of `abyss <link://slug/abyss>`__ and
decided that the word
`oubliette <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oubliette>`__ made a better
name. Oubliette is a much more appropriate description in understanding
the theme and purpose of the machine as a replacement for thevoid.

The name change happened a while ago but I'm bringing it up now because
oubliette is on my mind. Having just purchased six Western Digital 1.5TB
drives and another SATA controller, it is finally time to obsolete the
last remnants of thevoid. This actually stirs some amount of
sentimentality in me but, even though the hardware and operating system
are no longer that of thevoid, oubliette will carry the purpose and data
forward. It is almost as though oubliette is my
`ghola <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghola>`__ thevoid.

For those with technical interest, the drives will be arranged in an
mdadm RAID6 array with luks dm-crypt. This should provide me with 6TB,
secure storage, and two drives worth of failsafe.
