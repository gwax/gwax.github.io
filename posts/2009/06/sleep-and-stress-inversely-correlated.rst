I have noticed in my life that there is an inverse relation between the
quantity of sleep that I get and the degree to which I am experiencing
stress. It is unclear to me in which direction causality lies and it may
be nothing more than a correlation but I recall times in my past where I
went as many as three nights without sleep. All but the last of those
such times were before I understood the sensation of stress--such is my
disconnect from my emotional state.

As I think about it, I am inclined to suspect that not sleeping is a
sort of coping mechanism. In the extreme of those three night vigils, I
would reach a level of exhaustion that was so strong and pervasive as to
be able to wash over any other stress that I might have been feeling.
Eventually, I would sleep and the rest would be needed to such a degree
as to make everything else seem insubstantial.

It seems as though, for quite a long time, I have had to approach my
emotional state from an indirect point of view; sussing out how I might
be feeling by watching my reactions and back-tracking to the most
appropriate descriptor for my state. This is an arrangement that I have
come to accept and although it often works well enough, it can be a
little slow as far as processing is concerned.

I'm sure that there exist other thoughts on these matters and things
that I might express but, mostly, I am finding the issue rather
pertinent at this (just after) one in the morning time. I intended to go
to sleep a number of hours ago and, at this point, I will not get much
sleep, which causes me to suspect that I am avoiding sleep in some
manner correlated to stress. Unsurprisingly, this continues to be my
standard way of being; such is my life, I guess.
