Let me add Outlander to the list of awesome movies that you've never
heard of. Outlander came out in US theaters last Friday and having
followed it for a while, I went and saw it. Now, let me come clean here,
Outlander isn't a particularly good movie but it sure as Hell is a
totally awesome movie. That said, I do recommend going to see it while
it's still on the big screen.

Vikings versus aliens really should be all the synopsis that you need to
convince you to go see it but, I guess if you want more, I can give you
a brief synopsis. Earth is actually an undeveloped, abandoned seed
colony for the spacefaring human race. Kainan, a man from space, crash
lands his ship on Earth in viking-age Norway. Kainan soon realizes that
a particularly nasty alien, called a Moorwen, had stowed aboard his ship
and is now on the loose. There are subsequently a lot of spaceman/viking
integration/culture-shock dynamics and eventually it becomes
vikings+spaceman vs. alien monster.

Just to be clear, I keep saying that this is vikings vs. aliens because
that's both what it purports to be and what it delivers phenomenally
well. Outlander has cult classic written all over it.
